        Typst's bundle export format (experimental).

        #info[
          Bundle export is only available for experimentation behind a feature flag.
          Do not use this feature for production use cases. In the CLI, you can
          experiment with it by passing `--features bundle` or setting the
          `TYPST_FEATURES` environment variable to `bundle`. To use both the
          `bundle` and the `html` feature at the same time, specify both separated
          with a comma (i.e. `bundle,html`). In the web app, bundle export is not
          available at this time.
        ]

        With Typst's bundle export, you can emit multiple output files from a single
        Typst project. Bundle output is useful for creating multi-page websites with
        HTML export, but it is not limited to HTML export. You can create bundles
        containing any combination of @html[HTML pages], @pdf[PDFs],
        @format.png[PNGs], @format.svg[SVGs], and arbitrary @asset[assets].

        = Exporting as a bundle <exporting-as-a-bundle>
        == Command Line <command-line>
        Pass `--format bundle` to the `compile` or `watch` subcommand. Note that you
        must also pass `--features bundle` or set `TYPST_FEATURES=bundle` to enable
        this experimental export target.

        When using `typst watch`, Typst will launch a live-reloading HTTP server
        serving your files. You can configure it as follows:

        - Pass `--port` to change the port. (Defaults to the first free port in the
          range 3000-3005.)
        - Pass `--no-reload` to disable injection of a live reload script into HTML
          pages. (The HTML that is written to disk isn't affected either way.)
          Non-HTML documents do not support live reload.
        - Pass `--no-serve` to disable the server altogether.

        Not currently available.

        = Creating files <creating-files>
        A bundle is a collection of files. Each of these bundle files falls into one
        of two categories: Document or asset. A @document takes @content[content]
        that is exported with one of Typst's other export formats. Meanwhile, an
        @asset takes raw @bytes[byte data] of your choice that will be written to
        disk as-is. Both elements take the desired output path as their first
        argument.

        The example below shows a basic example of how bundle export could be used
        in practice:

        ```typ
        #document("index.html", title: [Home])[
          #title()
          - #link(<blog>)[Go to blog]
        ]

        #document("blog.html", title: [Blog])[
          #title()
          Welcome to my blog!

          ...

          This blog also exists as a
          #link(<blog-pdf>)[single PDF].
        ] <blog>

        #document("blog.pdf", title: [Blog])[
          ...
        ] <blog-pdf>

        #asset(
          "favicon.ico",
          read("images/favicon.ico", encoding: none),
        )
        ```

        In the example, we create two HTML documents: A home page and a blog. The
        home page links to the blog through a label link. Typst's built-in linking
        mechanism natively supports @link:links-in-bundle-export[cross-document
          links] and resolves the correct relative paths for you. The bundle also
        contains a PDF version of the blog, which is linked from the HTML version.
        In practice, you could now share the content between the HTML and PDF
        version by storing it in a variable and using it in both. This is omitted
        here for brevity. Finally, the bundle contains an icon asset for the
        website. In this case, we're providing the asset's data by reading a file
        from disk. Alternatively, it's also possible to generate asset data from
        within Typst (e.g. via a function like @json.encode).

        Documents and assets are normal elements, so you can use them with Typst's
        usual scripting, styling, and introspection mechanisms. For more details,
        refer to the @document and @asset documentation.

        = Introspection <introspection>
        Introspections always observe the full bundle rather than individual
        documents. For instance, querying for headings will give you all headings in
        all documents rather than the ones in the current document. Similarly,
        labels are global to the bundle—you can locate and
        @link:links-in-bundle-export[link to labels in other documents]. Counters
        and states are likewise global. #footnote[An exception to this forms the
          page counter, which is (naturally) per document.] In particular, if you
        enable things like heading numbering, the numbering will progress
        consecutively across the full bundle.

        If you're using bundle export to build one conceptual work that is split up
        across multiple output files, this is typically what you want. If, however,
        you're using bundle export to export multiple conceptually separate works,
        you might want introspections to consider each document in isolation.
        Currently, you'll have to do this manually (e.g. by resetting counters,
        adjusting selectors, etc.) We

        the future.

        Adds a custom file to a bundle.

        This function creates a single file in a @format.bundle[bundle], from
        @bytes[raw byte data]. Unlike @document[documents], assets will be emitted
        as-is without undergoing compilation.

        The `asset` function can be combined with @read to copy a file from the
        project into the output bundle. The first argument to `asset` defines the
        output path for the asset in the bundle, while the path passed to `read`
        defines where in the project to read the data from.

        ```typ
        // Copy the file `styles.css` into the bundle.
        #asset("styles.css", read("styles.css"))
        ```

        That said, `asset` is not tied to `read`. You can also generate bytes
        directly or use a function like @json.encode to emit serialized data.

        ```typ
        // Emits a JSON file with the number
        // of headings in the document.
        #context {
          let headings = query(heading)
          let meta = (
            count: headings.len(),
          )
          asset("meta.json", json.encode(meta))
        }

        #document("doc.pdf")[
          = Introduction
          = Conclusion
        ]
        ```

        This would emit a `meta.json` file with the following contents into the
        resulting bundle:

        ```json
        {
          "count": 2
        }
        ```

        This function is defined on the @format.bundle element, but is also
        available directly in the global scope. It may only be used in the
        @format.bundle[bundle] target.
