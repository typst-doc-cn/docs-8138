        Identifies an element in the document.

        A location uniquely identifies an element in the document and lets you
        access its absolute position on the pages. You can retrieve the current
        location with the @here function and the location of a queried or shown
        element with the @content.location[`location()`] method on content.

        = #short-or-long[Locatable][Locatable elements] <locatable>
        Elements that are automatically assigned a location are called _locatable_
        and can be found with @query[queries]:

        - In the @reference:model[Model category], the following elements are
          locatable: @asset, @bibliography, @cite, @document, @emph, @enum, @figure,
          @figure.caption, @footnote, @footnote.entry, @heading, @link, @list,
          @outline, @outline.entry, @par, @quote, @ref, @strong, @table, @terms, and
          @title. Most of the elements in the _Model_ category are locatable because
          semantic elements like headings and figures are often
          used with introspection.

        - In the @reference:text[Text category], the @raw element and the
          decoration elements @underline, @overline, @strike, and @highlight are
          locatable as these are also quite semantic in nature.

        - In the @reference:introspection[Introspection category], the @metadata
          element is locatable as being queried for is its primary purpose.

        - In the other categories, most elements are not locatable. Exceptions are
          @math.equation, @image, and @pdf.attach.

        To find out whether a specific element is locatable, you can try to @query
        for it.

        Note that you can still observe elements that are not locatable in queries
        through other means, for instance, when they have a label attached to them.

        Returns the page number for this location.

        Note that this does not return the value of the @counter[page counter]
        at this location, but the true page number (starting from one).

        If you want to know the value of the page counter, use
        `{counter(page).at(loc)}` instead.

        Can be used with @here to retrieve the physical page position of the
        current context:

        ```example
        #context [
          I am located on
          page #here().page()
        ]
        ```

        Returns a dictionary with the page number and the x, y position for this
        location. The page number starts at one and the coordinates are measured
        from the top-left of the page.

        If you only need the page number, use `page()` instead as it allows
        Typst to skip unnecessary work.

        Returns the page numbering pattern of the page at this location. This
        can be used when displaying the page counter in order to obtain the
        local numbering. This is useful if you are building custom indices or
        outlines.

        If the page numbering is set to `{none}` at that location, this function
        returns `{none}`.
