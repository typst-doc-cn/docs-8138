          Finds elements in the document.

          The `query` function lets you search your document for elements of a
          particular type or with a particular label. To use it, you first need to
          ensure that @reference:context[context] is available.

          In the example below, we manually create a table of contents instead of
          using the @outline function.

          To do this, we first query for all headings in the document at level 1 and
          where `outlined` is true. Querying only for headings at level 1 ensures
          that, for the purpose of this example, sub-headings are not included in the
          table of contents. The `outlined` field is used to exclude the "Table of
          Contents" heading itself.

          Note that we open a `context` to be able to use the `query` function.

          To get the page numbers, we first get the location of the elements returned
          by `query` with @content.location[`location`]. We then also retrieve the
          @location.page-numbering[page numbering] and
          @counter:page-counter[page counter] at that location and apply the numbering
          to the counter.

          To resolve all your queries, Typst evaluates and layouts parts of the
          document multiple times. However, there is no guarantee that your queries
          can actually be completely resolved. If you aren't careful a query can
          affect itself—leading to a result that never stabilizes.

          In the example below, we query for all headings in the document. We then
          generate as many headings. In the beginning, there's just one heading,
          titled `Real`. Thus, `count` is `1` and one `Fake` heading is generated.
          Typst sees that the query's result has changed and processes it again. This
          time, `count` is `2` and two `Fake` headings are generated. This goes on and
          on. As we can see, the output has a finite amount of headings. This is
          because Typst simply gives up after a few attempts.

          In general, you should try not to write queries that affect themselves. The
          same words of caution also apply to other introspection features like
          @counter[counters] and @state[state].

          let elems = query(heading)
          let count = elems.len()
          count * [= Fake]

          You can also perform queries from the command line, using the `typst eval`
          command. This command evaluates Typst code, potentially in the context of a
          document, and outputs the resulting value in serialized form. It takes the
          code to evaluate as its first argument and (optionally) the path to a
          document via `--in`.

      #babel(
        en: [
          This command tells Typst to compile `example.typ` and then run the code
          `{query(<note>)}` with access to the resulting document.
