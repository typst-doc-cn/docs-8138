        Finds elements in the document.

        The `query` function lets you search your document for elements of a
        particular type or with a particular label. To use it, you first need to
        ensure that @reference:context[context] is available.

        = Finding elements <finding-elements>
        In the example below, we manually create a table of contents instead of
        using the @outline function.

        To do this, we first query for all headings in the document at level 1 and
        where `outlined` is true. Querying only for headings at level 1 ensures
        that, for the purpose of this example, sub-headings are not included in the
        table of contents. The `outlined` field is used to exclude the "Table of
        Contents" heading itself.

        Note that we open a `context` to be able to use the `query` function.

        ```example
        >>> #set page(
        >>>  width: 240pt,
        >>>  height: 180pt,
        >>>  margin: (top: 20pt, bottom: 35pt)
        >>> )
        #set page(numbering: "1")

        #heading(outlined: false)[
          Table of Contents
        ]
        #context {
          let chapters = query(
            heading.where(
              level: 1,
              outlined: true,
            )
          )
          for chapter in chapters {
            let loc = chapter.location()
            let nr = counter(page).display(at: loc)
            [#chapter.body #h(1fr) #nr \ ]
          }
        }

        = Introduction
        #lorem(10)
        #pagebreak()

        == Sub-Heading
        #lorem(8)

        = Discussion
        #lorem(18)
        ```

        To get the page numbers, we first get the location of the elements returned
        by `query` with @content.location[`location`]. We then also retrieve the
        @location.page-numbering[page numbering] and
        @counter:page-counter[page counter] at that location and apply the numbering
        to the counter.

        = #short-or-long[Caution][A word of caution] <caution>
        To resolve all your queries, Typst evaluates and layouts parts of the
        document multiple times. However, there is no guarantee that your queries
        can actually be completely resolved. If you aren't careful a query can
        affect itself—leading to a result that never stabilizes.

        In the example below, we query for all headings in the document. We then
        generate as many headings. In the beginning, there's just one heading,
        titled `Real`. Thus, `count` is `1` and one `Fake` heading is generated.
        Typst sees that the query's result has changed and processes it again. This
        time, `count` is `2` and two `Fake` headings are generated. This goes on and
        on. As we can see, the output has a finite amount of headings. This is
        because Typst simply gives up after a few attempts.

        In general, you should try not to write queries that affect themselves. The
        same words of caution also apply to other introspection features like
        @counter[counters] and @state[state].

        #example(
          ```
          = Real
          #context {
            let elems = query(heading)
            let count = elems.len()
            count * [= Fake]
          }
          ```,
          warnings: false,
        )

        = Command line queries <command-line-queries>
        You can also perform queries from the command line, using the `typst eval`
        command. This command evaluates Typst code, potentially in the context of a
        document, and outputs the resulting value in serialized form. It takes the
        code to evaluate as its first argument and (optionally) the path to a
        document via `--in`.

        Consider the following `example.typ` file which contains some invisible
        @metadata[metadata]:

        ```typ
        #metadata("This is a note") <note>
        ```

        You can execute a query on it as follows using Typst's CLI.

        ```sh
        $ typst eval 'query(<note>)' --in example.typ
        [
          {
            "func": "metadata",
            "value": "This is a note",
            "label": "<note>"
          }
        ]
        ```

        This command tells Typst to compile `example.typ` and then run the code
        `{query(<note>)}` with access to the resulting document.

        *Note:* The code is surrounded with quotes to avoid special characters being
        interpreted by the shell. How to quote strings depends on your
        platform/shell.

        == Retrieving a specific field <retrieving-a-specific-field>
        Frequently, you're interested in only one specific field of the resulting
        elements. In the case of the `metadata` element, the `value` field is the
        interesting one. You can extract just this field by adjusting the code.

        ```sh
        $ typst eval 'query(<note>).map(it => it.value)' --in example.typ
        ["This is a note"]
        ```

        If you are interested in just a single element, you can also use the
        @array.first[`first()`] method to extract just it.

        ```sh
        $ typst eval 'query(<note>).first().value' --in example.typ
        "This is a note"
        ```

        == Querying for a specific export target <querying-for-a-specific-export-target>
        In case you need to query a document when exporting for a specific target,
        you can use the `--target` argument. Valid values are `paged`, and `html`
        (if the @html feature is enabled).
