        Counts through pages, elements, and more.

        With the counter function, you can access and modify counters for pages,
        headings, figures, and more. Moreover, you can define custom counters for
        other things you want to count.

        Since counters change throughout the course of the document, their current
        value is _contextual._ It is recommended to read the chapter on
        @reference:context[context] before continuing here.

        = #short-or-long[Accessing][Accessing a counter] <accessing>
        To access the raw value of a counter, we can use the @counter.get[`get`]
        function. This function returns an @array[array]: Counters can have multiple
        levels (in the case of headings for sections, subsections, and so on), and
        each item in the array corresponds to one level.

        ```example
        #set heading(numbering: "1.")

        = Introduction
        Raw value of heading counter is
        #context counter(heading).get()
        ```

        = #short-or-long[Displaying][Displaying a counter] <displaying>
        Often, we want to display the value of a counter in a more human-readable
        way. To do that, we can call the @counter.display[`display`] function on the
        counter. This function retrieves the current counter value and formats it
        either with a provided or with an automatically inferred
        @numbering[numbering].

        ```example
        #set heading(numbering: "1.")

        = Introduction
        Some text here.

        = Background
        The current value is: #context {
          counter(heading).display()
        }

        Or in roman numerals: #context {
          counter(heading).display("I")
        }
        ```

        = #short-or-long[Modifying][Modifying a counter] <modifying>
        To modify a counter, you can use the `step` and `update` methods:

        - The `step` method increases the value of the counter by one. Because
          counters can have multiple levels , it optionally takes a `level`
          argument. If given, the counter steps at the given depth.

        - The `update` method allows you to arbitrarily modify the counter. In its
          basic form, you give it an integer (or an array for multiple levels). For
          more flexibility, you can instead also give it a function that receives
          the current value and returns a new value.

        The heading counter is stepped before the heading is displayed, so
        `Analysis` gets the number seven even though the counter is at six after the
        second update.

        ```example
        #set heading(numbering: "1.")

        = Introduction
        #counter(heading).step()

        = Background
        #counter(heading).update(3)
        #counter(heading).update(n => n * 2)

        = Analysis
        Let's skip 7.1.
        #counter(heading).step(level: 2)

        == Analysis
        Still at #context {
          counter(heading).display()
        }
        ```

        = Element counters <element-counters>
        Above, there are various examples of using the @heading counter. Headings
        are just one kind of element that can be counted. In general, counters can
        count through any kind of @location:locatable[_locatable_ element].

        Additionally, a counter can also count just those elements that match a
        specific @selector. For example, `{counter(figure.where(kind: image))}`
        counts figures containing images, but ignores other kinds of figures.

        = Page counter <page-counter>
        The page counter is special. It is automatically stepped at each pagebreak.
        But like other counters, you can also step it manually. For example, you
        could have Roman page numbers for your preface, then switch to Arabic page
        numbers for your main content and reset the page counter to one.

        ```example
        >>> #set page(
        >>>   height: 100pt,
        >>>   margin: (bottom: 24pt, rest: 16pt),
        >>> )
        #set page(numbering: "(i)")

        = Preface
        The preface is numbered with
        roman numerals.

        #set page(numbering: "1 / 1")
        #counter(page).update(1)

        = Main text
        Here, the counter is reset to one.
        We also display both the current
        page and total number of pages in
        Arabic numbers.
        ```

        = Custom counters <custom-counters>
        To define your own counter, call the `counter` function with a string as a
        key. This key identifies the counter globally.

        ```example
        #let mine = counter("mycounter")
        #context mine.display() \
        #mine.step()
        #context mine.display() \
        #mine.update(c => c * 3)
        #context mine.display()
        ```

        = How to step <how-to-step>
        When you define and use a custom counter, in general, you should first step
        the counter and then display it. This way, the stepping behaviour of a
        counter can depend on the element it is stepped for. If you were writing a
        counter for, let's say, theorems, your theorem's definition would thus first
        include the counter step and only then display the counter and the theorem's
        contents.

        ```example
        #let c = counter("theorem")
        #let theorem(it) = block[
          #c.step()
          *Theorem #context c.display():*
          #it
        ]

        #theorem[$1 = 1$]
        #theorem[$2 < 3$]
        ```

        The rationale behind this is best explained on the example of the heading
        counter: An update to the heading counter depends on the heading's level. By
        stepping directly before the heading, we can correctly step from `1` to
        `1.1` when encountering a level 2 heading. If we were to step after the
        heading, we wouldn't know what to step to.

        Because counters should always be stepped before the elements they count,
        they always start at zero. This way, they are at one for the first display
        (which happens after the first step).

        = Time travel <time-travel>
        Counters can travel through time! You can find out the final value of the
        counter before it is reached and even determine what the value was at any
        particular location in the document.

        ```example
        #let mine = counter("mycounter")

        = Values
        #context [
          Value here: #mine.get() \
          At intro: #mine.at(<intro>) \
          Final value: #mine.final()
        ]

        #mine.update(n => n + 3)

        = Introduction <intro>
        #lorem(10)

        #mine.step()
        #mine.step()
        ```

        = #short-or-long[Other State][Other kinds of state] <other-state>
        The `counter` type is closely related to @state[state] type. Read its
        documentation for more details on state management in Typst and why it
        doesn't just use normal variables for counters.
