        A thematic break that separates sections of content.

        By default, it renders as a horizontal line, but it can be customized
        through show rules.

        = Example <example>
        ```example
        She left without a word.
        #divider()
        Three days later, she returned.
        ```

        = Styling <styling>
        The divider can be styled through show rules.

        Since the divider shows as a line by default, you can use a set rule to
        adjust the line's stroke:

        ```example
        #show divider: set line(stroke: 2pt + red)
        First part
        #divider()
        Second part
        ```

        You can also fully replace the divider with custom content like a floral or
        asterisks, but then you should wrap it in a block to preserve spacing:

        ```example
        #show divider: set align(center)
        #show divider: block[∗ ∗ ∗]
        Chapter 1
        #divider()
        Chapter 2
        ```
