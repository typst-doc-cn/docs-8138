        The alignment that enum numbers should have.

        By default, this is set to `{end}`, which aligns enum numbers
        horizontally towards the end of the current text direction (in a
        left-to-right script, for example, this is the same as `{right}`). In
        addition, the lack of a vertical alignment places each number vertically
        just above the baseline of the item, as if it were part of its first
        line of text.

        The choice of `{end}` for horizontal alignment of enum numbers is
        usually preferred over `{start}`, as numbers then grow away from the
        text instead of towards it. This option lets you override this
        behaviour, however.

        As for vertical alignment, it can be overridden if baseline alignment is
        not desired. For example, an alignment of `{end + top}` would always
        place the marker vertically near the top of the item, whereas
      ]) `{end +
bottom}` #babel(en: [
        would move it near the bottom.

        Also to note is that the @list[unordered list] possesses a similar
        option named `marker-align` instead, which also controls both axes of
        marker alignment in the exact same way as `enum` numbers.
