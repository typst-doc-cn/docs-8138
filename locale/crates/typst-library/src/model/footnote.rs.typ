          A footnote.

          Includes additional remarks and references on the same page with footnotes.
          A footnote will insert a superscript number that links to the note at the
          bottom of the page. Notes are numbered sequentially throughout your document
          and can break across multiple pages.

          To customize the appearance of the entry in the footnote listing, see
          @footnote.entry. The footnote itself is realized as a normal superscript, so
          you can use a set rule on the @super function to customize it. You can also
          apply a show rule to customize only the footnote marker (superscript number)
          in the running text.

          The footnote automatically attaches itself to the preceding word, even if
          there is a space before it in the markup. To force space, you can use the
          string `[#" "]` or explicit @h[horizontal spacing].

          By giving a label to a footnote, you can have multiple references to it.
