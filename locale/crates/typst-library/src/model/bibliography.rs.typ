        A bibliography / reference listing.

        You can create a new bibliography by calling this function with a path to a
        bibliography file in either one of two formats:

        - A Hayagriva `.yaml`/`.yml` file. Hayagriva is a new bibliography file
          format designed for use with Typst. Visit its
          #link("https://github.com/typst/hayagriva/blob/main/docs/file-format.md")[documentation]
          for more details.
        - A BibLaTeX `.bib` file.

        As soon as you add a bibliography somewhere in your document, you can start
        citing things with reference syntax (`[@key]`) or explicit calls to the
        @cite[citation] function (`[#cite(<key>)]`). The bibliography will only show
        entries for works that were referenced in the document.

        = Example <example>
        ```example
        This was already noted by
        pirates long ago. @arrgh

        Multiple sources say ...
        @arrgh @netwok.

        #bibliography("works.bib")
        ```

        = Styles <styles>
        Typst offers a wide selection of built-in
        @bibliography.style[citation and bibliography styles]. Beyond those, you can
        add and use custom #link("https://citationstyles.org/")[CSL] (Citation Style
        Language) files. Wondering which style to use? Here are some good defaults
        based on what discipline you're working in:

        #docs-table(
          table.header[Fields][Typical Styles],

          [Engineering, IT],
          [`{"ieee"}`],

          [Psychology, Life Sciences],
          [`{"apa"}`],

          [Social sciences],
          [`{"chicago-author-date"}`],

          [Humanities],
          [`{"mla"}`, `{"chicago-notes"}`, `{"harvard-cite-them-right"}`],

          [Economics],

          [Physics],
          [`{"american-physics-society"}`],
        )

        = Multiple bibliographies <multiple-bibliographies>
        When a Typst document contains multiple bibliographies, each citation is
        assigned to one of them. By default, Typst will automatically pick a
        suitable bibliography (typically, the closest following one that contains
        the referenced citation key). This covers common cases like by-chapter or
        thematic bibliographies. For more fine-grained control, citations can be
        explicitly targeted by a bibliography through a
        @bibliography.target[`target`] selector.

        Typst will automatically assign each citation in the document to a
        bibliography. Concretely, a citation will be assigned to (in order of
        precedence)
        + the first bibliography that includes it in its `target` selector; or
          if no such bibliography exists
        + the closest _following_ bibliography with `{target: auto}` that
          contains its key; or if no such bibliography follows
        + the closest _preceding_ bibliography with `{target: auto}` that
          contains its key.

        Conceptually groups this bibliography with other bibliographies for
        numbering purposes. Bibliographies in the same group will assign
        consecutive citation numbers.

        This can be:
        - `{none}`: The bibliography will be numbered in isolation.
        - `{auto}`: The bibliography will be consecutively numbered with all
          other bibliographies in the `{auto}` group.
        - A @str[string]: The bibliography will be consecutively numbered with
          all other bibliographies with the same `group` value.

        The `{auto}` group works just like any string group, but it is the
        canonical default group.
