        A table of items.

        Tables are used to arrange content in cells. Cells can contain arbitrary
        content, including multiple paragraphs and are specified in row-major order.
        For a hands-on explanation of all the ways you can use and customize tables
        in Typst, check out the @guides:tables[Table Guide].

        Because tables are just grids with different defaults for some cell
        properties (notably `stroke` and `inset`), refer to the
        @grid:track-size[grid documentation] for more information on how to size the
        table tracks and specify the cell appearance properties.

        If you are unsure whether you should be using a table or a grid, consider
        whether the content you are arranging semantically belongs together as a set
        of related data points or similar or whether you are just want to enhance
        your presentation by arranging unrelated content in a grid. In the former
        case, a table is the right choice, while in the latter case, a grid is more
        appropriate. Furthermore, Assistive Technology (AT) like screen readers will
        announce content in a `table` as tabular while a grid's content will be
        announced no different than multiple content blocks in the document flow. AT
        users will be able to navigate tables two-dimensionally by cell.

        Note that, to override a particular cell's properties or apply show rules on
        table cells, you can use the @table.cell element. See its documentation for
        more information.

        Although the `table` and the `grid` share most properties, set and show
        rules on one of them do not affect the other. Locating most of your styling
        in set and show rules is recommended, as it keeps the table's actual usages
        clean and easy to read. It also allows you to easily change the appearance
        of all tables in one place.

        To give a table a caption and make it @ref[referenceable], put it into a
        @figure[figure].

        = Example <example>
        The example below demonstrates some of the most common table options.

        ```example
        #table(
          columns: (1fr, auto, auto),
          inset: 10pt,
          align: horizon,
          table.header(
            [], [*Volume*], [*Parameters*],
          ),
          image("cylinder.svg"),
          $ pi h (D^2 - d^2) / 4 $,
          [
            $h$: height \
            $D$: outer radius \
            $d$: inner radius
          ],
          image("tetrahedron.svg"),
          $ sqrt(2) / 12 a^3 $,
          [$a$: edge length]
        )
        ```

        Much like with grids, you can use @table.cell to customize the appearance
        and the position of each cell.

        ```example
        >>> #set page(width: auto)
        >>> #set text(font: "IBM Plex Sans")
        >>> #let gray = rgb("#565565")
        >>>
        #set table(
          stroke: none,
          gutter: 0.2em,
          fill: (x, y) =>
            if x == 0 or y == 0 { gray },
          inset: (right: 1.5em),
        )

        #show table.cell: it => {
          if it.x == 0 or it.y == 0 {
            set text(white)
            strong(it)
          } else if it.body == [] {
            // Replace empty cells with 'N/A'
            pad(..it.inset)[_N/A_]
          } else {
            it
          }
        }

        #let a = table.cell(
          fill: green.lighten(60%),
        )[A]
        #let b = table.cell(
          fill: aqua.lighten(60%),
        )[B]

        #table(
          columns: 4,
          [], [Exam 1], [Exam 2], [Exam 3],

          [John], [], a, [],
          [Mary], [], a, a,
          [Robert], b, a, b,
        )
        ```

        = Accessibility <accessibility>
        Tables are challenging to consume for users of Assistive Technology (AT). To
        make the life of AT users easier, we strongly recommend that you use
        @table.header and @table.footer to mark the header and footer sections of
        your table. This will allow AT to announce the column labels for each cell.

        Because navigating a table by cell is more cumbersome than reading it
        visually, you should consider making the core information in your table
        available as text as well. You can do this by wrapping your table in a
        @figure[figure] and using its caption to summarize the table's content.

        A repeatable table header.

        You should wrap your tables' heading rows in this function even if you do
        not plan to wrap your table across pages because Typst uses this function to
        attach accessibility metadata to tables and ensure
        @guides:accessibility:basics[Universal Access] to your document.

        You can use the `repeat` parameter to control whether your table's header
        will be repeated across pages.

        Currently, this function is unsuitable for creating a header column or
        single header cells. Either use regular cells, or, if you are exporting a
        PDF, you can also use the @pdf.header-cell function to mark a cell as a
        header cell. Likewise, you can use @pdf.data-cell to mark cells in this
        function as data cells. Note that these functions are not final and thus
        only available when you enable the `a11y-extras` feature (see the

        properties for a particular cell, or use it in show rules to apply certain
        styles to multiple cells at once.

        Perhaps the most important use case of `{table.cell}` is to make a cell span
        multiple columns and/or rows with the `colspan` and `rowspan` fields.

        ```example
        >>> #set page(width: auto)
        #show table.cell.where(y: 0): strong
        #set table(
          stroke: (x, y) => if y == 0 {
            (bottom: 0.7pt + black)
          },
          align: (x, y) => (
            if x > 0 { center }
            else { left }
          )
        )

        #table(
          columns: 3,
          table.header(
            [Substance],
            [Subcritical °C],
            [Supercritical °C],
          ),
          [Hydrochloric Acid],
          [12.0], [92.1],
          [Sodium Myreth Sulfate],
          [16.6], [104],
          [Potassium Hydroxide],
          table.cell(colspan: 2)[24.7],
        )
        ```

        For example, you can override the fill, alignment or inset for a single
        cell:

        ```example
        >>> #set page(width: auto)
        // You can also import those.
        #import table: cell, header

        #table(
          columns: 2,
          align: center,
          header(
            [*Trip progress*],
            [*Itinerary*],
          ),
          cell(
            align: right,
            fill: fuchsia.lighten(80%),
            [🚗],
          ),
          [Get in, folks!],
          [🚗], [Eat curbside hotdog],
          cell(align: left)[🌴🚗],
          cell(
            inset: 0.06em,
            text(1.62em)[🏝️🌅🌊],
          ),
        )
        ```

        You may also apply a show rule on `table.cell` to style all cells at once.
        Combined with selectors, this allows you to apply styles based on a cell's
        position:

        ```example
        #show table.cell.where(x: 0): strong

        #table(
          columns: 3,
          gutter: 3pt,
          [Name], [Age], [Strength],
          [Hannes], [36], [Grace],
          [Irma], [50], [Resourcefulness],
          [Vikram], [49], [Perseverance],
        )
        ```
      ],
    ),
