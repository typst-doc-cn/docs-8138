          A reference to a label or bibliography.

          Takes a label and cross-references it. There are two kind of references,
          determined by its @ref.form[`form`]: `{"normal"}` and `{"page"}`.

          The default, a `{"normal"}` reference, produces a textual reference to a
          label. For example, a reference to a heading will yield an appropriate
          string such as "Section 1" for a reference to the first heading. The word
          "Section" depends on the @text.lang[`lang`] setting and is localized
          accordingly. The references are also links to the respective element.
          Reference syntax can also be used to @cite[cite] from a bibliography.

          As the default form requires a supplement and numbering, the label must be
          attached to a _referenceable element_. Referenceable elements include
          @heading[headings], @figure[figures], @math.equation[equations], and
          @footnote[footnotes]. To create a custom referenceable element like a
          theorem, you can create a figure of a custom @figure.kind[`kind`] and write
          a show rule for it. In the future, there might be a more direct way to
          define a custom referenceable element.

          If you just want to link to a labelled element and not get an automatic
          textual reference, consider using the @link function instead.

          A `{"page"}` reference produces a page reference to a label, displaying the
          page number at its location. You can use the
          @page.supplement[page's supplement] to modify the text before the page
          number. Unlike a `{"normal"}` reference, the label can be attached to any
          element as long as the corresponding @page.numbering[page's numbering] is
          set.
