          The document element is the single source of truth for document metadata.
          With it, you can specify the document's title, authors, date, etc. in one
          place. Typically, the element is used with a
          @reference:styling:set-rules[set rule] like this:
        ],

      ```example
      #set document(title: [My doc])

      embedded in PDF metadata.

          By default, the metadata is embedded into the output, but not visibly
          rendered in the document. However, it becomes
          @reference:context[contextually available] to the full document and can be
          used by elements and templates. For instance, the built-in @title element
          automatically picks up the configured document title:
        ],

      ```example
      #set document(title: [My doc])

      embedded in PDF metadata.

      #babel(

          In a similar fashion to the `title` element, you can also access metadata
          yourself using a @reference:context[context expression].

          @reference:styling:set-rules[set rules]. Such set rules must only occur at

            _document information dictionary_ as well as XMP metadata.

          - HTML export only supports the `title`, `description`, `author`, and
            `keywords` properties. The `date` property is not supported as the HTML
            standard has no provision for it.
