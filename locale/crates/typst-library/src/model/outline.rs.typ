          By setting the `target` parameter, the outline can be used to generate a
          list of other kinds of elements than headings.

          In the example below, we list all figures containing images by setting
          `target` to `{figure.where(kind: image)}`. Just the same, we could have set
          it to `{figure.where(kind: table)}` to generate a list of tables.

          We could also set it to just `figure`, without using a

          At the most basic level, you can style the outline by setting properties on
          it and its entries. This way, you can customize the outline's
          @outline.title[title], how outline entries are @outline.indent[indented],
          and how the space between an entry's text and its page number should be
          @outline.entry.fill[filled].

          Richer customization is possible through configuration of the outline's
          @outline.entry[entries]. The outline generates one entry for each outlined
          element.

          For full control, you can also write a transformational show rule on
          `outline.entry`. However, the logic for properly formatting and indenting
          outline entries is quite complex and the outline entry itself only contains
          two fields: The level and the outlined element.

          For this reason, various helper functions are provided. You can mix and
          match these to compose an entry from just the parts you like.

          The default show rule for an outline entry looks like this
          #footnote[The outline of equations is the exception to this rule as it does
            not have a body and thus does not use indented layout.]:

          - The @outline.entry.indented[`indented`] function takes an optional prefix
            and inner content and automatically applies the proper indentation to it,
            such that different entries align nicely and long headings wrap properly.

          - The @outline.entry.prefix[`prefix`] function formats the element's
            numbering (if any). It also appends a supplement for certain elements.

          - The @outline.entry.inner[`inner`] function combines the element's
            @outline.entry.body[`body`], the filler, and the
            @outline.entry.page[`page` number].

          You can use these individual functions to format the outline entry in
          different ways. Let's say, you'd like to fully remove the filler and page
          numbers. To achieve this, you could write a show rule like this:

          How to indent the outline's entries.

          - `{auto}`: Indents the numbering/prefix of a nested entry with the
            title of its parent entry. If the entries are not numbered (e.g., via
            @heading.numbering[heading numbering]), this instead simply inserts a
            fixed amount of `{1.2em}` indent per level.

          - @relative[Relative length]: Indents the entry by the specified length
            per nesting level. Specifying `{2em}`, for instance, would indent
            top-level headings by `{0em}` (not nested), second level headings by
            `{2em}` (nested once), third-level headings by `{4em}` (nested twice)
            and so on.

          - @function[Function]: You can further customize this setting with a
            function. That function receives the nesting level as a parameter
            (starting at 0 for top-level headings/elements) and should return a
            (relative) length. For example, `{n => n * 2em}` would be equivalent
            to just specifying `{2em}`.
