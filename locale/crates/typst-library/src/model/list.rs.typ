        A bullet list.

        marker.

        Normal list.
        - Text
        - Math
        - Layout
        - ...

        Multiple lines.
        - This list item spans multiple
          lines because it is indented.

        Function call.
        #list(
          [Foundations],
          [Calculate],
          [Construct],
          [Data Loading],
        )
        ```

        = Syntax <syntax>
        This function also has dedicated syntax: Start a line with a hyphen,
        followed by a space to create a list item. A list item can contain multiple
        paragraphs and other block-level content. All content that is indented more
        than an item's marker becomes part of that item.

  "ListElem::tight": (

        Defines the default @list.spacing[spacing] of the list. If it is
        `{false}`, the items are spaced apart with
        @par.spacing[paragraph spacing]. If it is `{true}`, they use
        @par.leading[paragraph leading] instead. This makes the list more
        compact, which can look better if the items are short.

        In markup mode, the value of this parameter is determined based on
        whether items are separated with a blank line. If items directly follow
        each other, this is set to `{true}`; if items are separated by a blank
        line, this is set to `{false}`. The markup-defined tightness cannot be
        overridden with set rules.

        ```example
        - If a list has a lot of text, and
          maybe other inline content, it
          should not be tight anymore.

        - To make a list wide, simply insert
          a blank line between the items.

        The marker which introduces each item.

        Instead of plain content, you can also pass an array with multiple
        markers that should be used for nested lists. If the list nesting depth
        exceeds the number of markers, the markers are cycled. For total
        control, you may pass a function that maps the list's nesting depth
        (starting from `{0}`) to a desired marker.

        ```example
        #set list(marker: [--])
        - A more classic list
        - With en-dashes

        #set list(marker: ([•], [--]))
        - Top-level
          - Nested
          - Items
        - Items

        Alignment to use for list markers.

        Vertical alignment is always relative to the height of the list items
        they are attached to. By default, it is unspecified, which means that
        each marker will vertically align with the baseline of the item it is
        attached to (which is usually its first line of text, or otherwise its
        top).

        Horizontal alignment, on the other hand, is relative to other markers at
        the same list level. By default, it is set to `{end}`, meaning that
        markers line up towards the end of the current text direction (`{right}`
        for LTR, `{left}` for RTL text). However, since markers at each level
        are usually identical, it is expected that horizontal alignment has no
        actual effect, most of the time. Regardless, it is still possible for it
        to make a difference in some cases, particularly if markers use counters
        or other forms of state to display different content for each item.

        ```example
        - Baseline \
          aligned

        #set list(marker-align: horizon)

        - Horizon \
          aligned

        The bullet list's children.

        When using the list syntax, adjacent items are automatically collected
        into lists, even through constructs like for loops.

        ```example
        #for letter in "ABC" [
          - Letter #letter
        ]
        ```
      ],
