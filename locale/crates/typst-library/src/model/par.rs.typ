          A logical subdivison of textual content.

          Typst automatically collects _inline-level_ elements into paragraphs.
          Inline-level elements include @text[text], @h[horizontal spacing],
          @box[boxes], and @math.equation[inline equations].

          To separate paragraphs, use a blank line (or an explicit @parbreak).
          Paragraphs are also automatically interrupted by any block-level element
          (like @block, @place, or anything that shows itself as one of these).

          The `par` element is primarily used in set rules to affect paragraph
          properties, but it can also be used to explicitly display its argument as a
          paragraph of its own. Then, the paragraph's body may not contain any
          block-level content.

          As explained above, usually paragraphs only contain inline-level content.
          However, you can integrate any kind of block-level content into a paragraph
          by wrapping it in a @box.

          Conversely, you can separate inline-level content from a paragraph by
          wrapping it in a @block. In this case, it will not become part of any
          paragraph at all. Read the following section for an explanation of why that
          matters and how it differs from just adding paragraph breaks around the
          content.

          When you add inline-level content to your document, Typst will automatically
          wrap it in paragraphs. However, a typical document also contains some text
          that is not semantically part of a paragraph, for example in a heading or
          caption.

          The rules for when Typst wraps inline-level content in a paragraph are as
          follows:

          - All text at the root of a document is wrapped in paragraphs.

          - Text in a container (like a `block`) is only wrapped in a paragraph if the
            container holds any block-level content. If all of the contents are
            inline-level, no paragraph is created.

          In the laid-out document, it's not immediately visible whether text became
          part of a paragraph. However, it is still important for various reasons:

          - Certain paragraph styling like `first-line-indent` will only apply to
            proper paragraphs, not any text. Similarly, `par` show rules of course
            only trigger on paragraphs.

          - A proper distinction between paragraphs and other text helps people who
            rely on Assistive Technology (AT) (such as screen readers) navigate and
            understand the document properly.

          - PDF export will generate a `P` tag only for paragraphs.

          - HTML export will generate a `<p>` tag only for paragraphs.

          When creating custom reusable components, you can and should take charge
          over whether Typst creates paragraphs. By wrapping text in a @block instead
          of just adding paragraph breaks around it, you can force the absence of a
          paragraph. Conversely, by adding a @parbreak after some content in a
          container, you can force it to become a paragraph even if it's just one
          word. This is, for example, what @list.tight[non-`tight`] lists do to force
          their items to become paragraphs.

          Leading defines the spacing between the @text.bottom-edge[bottom edge]

          default, these two properties are up to the font, but they can also be

          By setting top edge, bottom edge, and leading, you can also configure a
          consistent baseline-to-baseline distance. You could, for instance, set
          the leading to `{1em}`, the top-edge to `{0.8em}`, and the bottom-edge
          to `{-0.2em}` to get a baseline gap of exactly `{2em}`. The exact

        line. Spacing acts both above and below, collapsing to the greater of
        the amounts defined by adjacent paragraphs.

        Note that the current @align.alignment[alignment] still has an effect on

        @par.justification-limits[`justification-limits` property].

          How much the spacing between words and characters may be adjusted during
          justification.

          When justifying text, Typst needs to stretch or shrink a line to the
          full width of the measure. To achieve this, by default, it adjusts the
          spacing between words. Additionally, it can also adjust the spacing
          between individual characters. This property allows you to configure
          lower and upper bounds for these adjustments.

          The property accepts a dictionary with two entries, `spacing` and
          `tracking`, each containing a dictionary with the keys `min` and `max`.
          The `min` keys define down to which lower bound gaps may be shrunk while
          the `max` keys define up to which upper bound they may be stretched.

          - The `spacing` entry defines how much the width of spaces between words
            may be adjusted. It is closely related to @text.spacing and its `min`
            and `max` keys accept @relative[relative lengths], just like the
            `spacing` property.

            A `min` value of `{100%}` means that spaces should retain their normal
            size (i.e. not be shrunk), while a value of `{90% - 0.01em}` would
            indicate that a space can be shrunk to a width of 90% of its normal
            width minus 0.01× the current font size. Similarly, a `max` value of
            `{100% + 0.02em}` means that a space's width can be increased by 0.02×
            the current font size. The ratio part must always be positive. The
            length part, meanwhile, must not be positive for `min` and not be
            negative for `max`.

            Note that spaces may still be expanded beyond the `max` value if there
            is no way to justify the line otherwise. However, other means of
            justification (e.g. spacing apart characters if the `tracking` entry
            is configured accordingly) are first used to their maximum.

          - The `tracking` entry defines how much the spacing between letters may
            be adjusted. It is closely related to @text.tracking and its `min` and
            `max` keys accept @length[lengths], just like the `tracking` property.
            Unlike `spacing`, it does not accept relative lengths because the base
            of the relative length would vary for each character, leading to an
            uneven visual appearance. The behavior compared to `spacing` is as if
            the base was `{100%}`.

            Otherwise, the `min` and `max` values work just like for `spacing`. A
            `max` value of `{0.01em}` means that additional spacing amounting to
            0.01× of the current font size may be inserted between every pair of
            characters. Note that this also includes the gaps between spaces and
            characters, so for spaces the values of `tracking` act in addition to
            the values for `spacing`.

          If you only specify one of `spacing` or `tracking`, the other retains
          its previously set value (or the default if it was not previously set).

          If you want to enable character-level justification, a good value for
          the `min` and `max` keys is around `{0.01em}` to `{0.02em}` (negated for
          `min`). Using the same value for both gives a good baseline, but
          tweaking the two values individually may produce more balanced results,
          as demonstrated in the example below. Be careful not to set the bounds
          too wide, as it quickly looks unnatural.

          Using character-level justification is an impactful microtypographical
          technique that can improve the appearance of justified text, especially
          in narrow columns. Note though that character-level justification does
          not work with every font or language. For example, cursive fonts connect
          letters. Using character-level justification would lead to jagged
          connections.
