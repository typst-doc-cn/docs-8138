          A section heading.

          With headings, you can structure your document into sections. Each heading
          has a _level,_ which starts at one and is unbounded upwards. This level
          indicates the logical role of the following content (section, subsection,
          etc.) A top-level heading indicates a top-level section of the document (not
          the document's title). To insert a title, use the @title element instead.

          Typst can automatically number your headings for you. To enable numbering,
          specify how you want your headings to be numbered with a
          @numbering[numbering pattern or function].

          Independently of the numbering, Typst can also automatically generate an
          @outline[outline] of all headings for you. To exclude one or more headings
          from this outline, you can set the `outlined` parameter to `{false}`.

          When writing a @reference:styling:show-rules[show rule] that accesses the
          @heading.body[`body` field] to create a completely custom look for headings,
          make sure to wrap the content in a @block (which is implicitly
          @block.sticky[sticky] for headings through a built-in show-set rule). This
          prevents headings from becoming "orphans", i.e. remaining at the end of the
          page with the following content being on the next page.

          Headings have dedicated syntax: They can be created by starting a line with
          one or multiple equals signs, followed by a space. The number of equals
          signs determines the heading's logical nesting depth. The `{offset}` field
          can be set to configure the starting depth.

          Headings are important for accessibility, as they help users of Assistive
          Technologies (AT) like screen readers to navigate within your document.
          Screen reader users will be able to skip from heading to heading, or get an
          overview of all headings in the document.

          To make your headings accessible, you should not skip heading levels. This
          means that you should start with a first-level heading. Also, when the
          previous heading was of level 3, the next heading should be of level 3
          (staying at the same depth), level 4 (going exactly one level deeper), or
          level 1 or 2 (new hierarchically higher headings).

          element of which there should be only one per document.

          For this reason, in HTML export, a @title element will turn into an `<h1>`
          and headings turn into `<h2>` and lower (a level 1 heading thus turns into
          `<h2>`, a level 2 heading into `<h3>`, etc).
