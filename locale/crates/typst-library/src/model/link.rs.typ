          This function also has dedicated syntax: Text that starts with `http://` or
          `https://` is automatically turned into a link.

          To avoid automatic creation of a link, you can put the text in a
          @str[string]. To embed the string in markup, prefix it with a hash.
          Alternatively, if the link-like text is computer code, you may also put it
          in a @raw[`raw` element]. Note that, in both cases, the text may remain
          clickable in PDF because some PDF readers auto-detect links.

          The destination of a link should be clear from the link text itself, or at

        en: [
          In @html[HTML export], a link to a @label[label] or @location[location] will
          be turned into a fragment link to a named anchor point. To support this,
          targets without an existing ID will automatically receive an ID in the DOM.
          How this works varies by which kind of HTML node(s) the link target turned
          into:

          - If the link target turned into a single HTML element, that element will
            receive the ID. This is, for instance, typically the case when linking to
            a top-level heading (which turns into a single `<h2>` element).

          - If the link target turned into a single text node, the node will be
            wrapped in a `<span>`, which will then receive the ID.

          - If the link target turned into multiple nodes, the first node will receive
            the ID.

          - If the link target turned into no nodes at all, an empty span will be
            generated to serve as a link target.

          If you rely on a specific DOM structure, you should ensure that the link
          target turns into one or multiple elements, as the compiler makes no
          guarantees on the precise segmentation of text into text nodes.

          If present, the automatic ID generation tries to reuse the link target's
          label to create a human-readable ID. A label can be reused if:

          - All characters are alphabetic or numeric according to Unicode, or a
            hyphen, or an underscore.

          - The label does not start with a digit or hyphen.

          These rules ensure that the label is both a valid CSS identifier and a valid
          URL fragment for linking.

          As IDs must be unique in the DOM, duplicate labels might need disambiguation
          when reusing them as IDs. The precise rules for this are as follows:

          - If a label can be reused and is unique in the document, it will directly
            be used as the ID.

          - If it's reusable, but not unique, a suffix consisting of a hyphen and an
            integer will be added. For instance, if the label `<mylabel>` exists
            twice, it would turn into `mylabel-1` and `mylabel-2`.

          - Otherwise, a unique ID of the form `loc-` followed by an integer will be
            generated.

          In @format.bundle[bundle export], linking still works as usual. For
          instance, if you attach a label to an element in one document, links in
          other documents can reference that label. In addition, documents and assets
          are also directly linkable. To link to a full document or asset, you can
          attach a label to it or @query[query] for it and extract its
          @location[location].

          Cross-document links are emitted as relative paths (potentially with
          fragments). Typst automatically assigns anchor names per document based on
          the same rules as in HTML export. In HTML and SVG documents, these are
          emitted as `id` attributes on elements. In PDF documents, they are emitted
          as _named destinations._ PNG documents do not support linking.

          Note that links always use full relative paths. In some scenarios (primarily
          for multi-page websites), this may not be desirable. For instance, you may
          want to generate a `/blog/index.html` document while wanting to link to it
          as just `/blog`. Furthermore, your web server might treat `/blog` and
          `/blog/` as interchangeable and serve `/blog/index.html` for both. If a user
          then navigates to `/blog`, relative links to other pages generated by Typst
          will no longer work. Currently, Typst does not have a way to directly hook
          into the built-in link handling. That said, in HTML export, depending on
          your use case, it may be possible to adjust the built-in link handling with
          a show rule on `{html.elem.where(tag: "a")}`.

          - To link to web pages, `dest` should be a valid URL string. If the URL

            omitted, the email address or phone number will be the link's body,
            without the scheme.

          - To link to another part of the document, `dest` can take one of three
            forms:
            - A @label[label] attached to an element. If you also want automatic
              text for the link based on the element, consider using a
              @ref[reference] instead.
