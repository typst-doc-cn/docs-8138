        Raw text with optional syntax highlighting.

        Displays the text verbatim and in a monospace font. This is typically used
        to embed computer code into a document.

        Text given to this element will ignore markup syntax, such as `[*strong*]`
        or `[_emphasis_]`, and will be displayed verbatim. If you would like to
        display content with a monospace font while still allowing markup syntax,
        instead of using @raw, you can explicitly set the text font to a monospace
        font with the @text.font parameter.

        Raw elements are mainly produced with their @raw:syntax[dedicated syntax] by
        enclosing text with either one or three-plus backtick characters (``` ` ```)
        on both sides. When using three or more backticks, text immediately after
        the initial backticks will be treated as a @raw.lang[language tag] used for
        syntax highlighting, and the raw text begins after the first whitespace.

        = Example <example>
        ````example
        Adding `rbx` to `rcx` gives
        the desired result.

        What is ```rust fn main()``` in Rust
        would be ```c int main()``` in C.

        ```rust
        fn main() {
            println!("Hello World!");
        }
        ```

        This has ``` `backticks` ``` in it
        (but the spaces are trimmed). And
        ``` here``` the leading space is
        also trimmed.
        ````

        You can also construct a @raw element programmatically from a string (and
        provide the language tag via the optional @raw.lang[`lang`] parameter).

        ```example
        #raw("fn " + "main() {}", lang: "rust")
        ```

        If no syntax highlighting is available by default for your specified
        language tag (or if you want to override the built-in definition), you may
        provide a custom syntax specification file to the @raw.syntaxes[`syntaxes`]
        parameter.

        = Styling <styling>
        By default, the `raw` element uses the `DejaVu Sans Mono` font (included
        with Typst), with a smaller font size of `{0.8em}` (that is, 80% of the
        global font size). This is because monospace fonts tend to be visually
        larger than non-monospace fonts.

        You can customize these properties with show-set rules:

        ````example
        // Switch to Cascadia Code for both
        // inline and block raw.
        #show raw: set text(font: "Cascadia Code")

        // Reset raw blocks to the same size as normal text,
        // but keep inline raw at the reduced size.
        #show raw.where(block: true): set text(1em / 0.8)

        Now using the `Cascadia Code` font for raw text.
        Here's some Python code. It looks larger now:

        ```py
        def python():
          return 5 + 5
        ```
        ````

        In addition, you can customize the syntax highlighting colors by setting a
        custom theme through the @raw.theme[`theme`] parameter.

        For complete customization of the appearance of a raw block, a show rule on
        @raw.line could be helpful, such as to add line numbers.

        Note that in raw text, typesetting features like
        @text.hyphenate[hyphenation], @text.overhang[overhang],
        @text.cjk-latin-spacing[CJK-Latin spacing], and (for raw blocks)
        @par.justify[justification] will be disabled by default.

        = Syntax <syntax>
        This function has dedicated syntax that produces a raw element in both
        markup and code mode. You can enclose text in one or three-plus backtick
        characters (``` ` ```) on both sides to make it raw. The number of backticks
        must be the same on both sides, and the enclosed text cannot contain a group
        of that many backticks in a row. Writing just two backticks (``` `` ```)
        produces empty raw text.

        Notable differences from Markdown include that single backticks can enclose
        text spanning multiple lines without removing indentation, and that the
        three-plus backtick syntax still interprets language tags when used inline.

        Raw text enclosed in _single_ backticks has no way to specify a language tag
        and is always treated as inline for use within a paragraph, i.e. the
        @raw.block[`block`] parameter is `{false}`.

        Raw syntax using _three or more_ backticks has the following properties:

        - *After the initial backticks, the raw block is only terminated by a
          sequence of the same number of backticks*

          To include text containing a sequence of backticks, the initial and final
          backticks must have at least one more backtick than the sequence.

        - *If the raw text contains a linebreak, it will be block-level, otherwise
          it will be inline*

          This sets the @raw.block[`block`] parameter to `{true}` or `{false}`
          accordingly.

        - *Text immediately after the initial backticks, up to the first whitespace,
          is treated as a _language tag_ used for syntax highlighting*

          The specific rules for which text can be treated as the language tag are
          planned to change, and are @raw:language-tag-changes[explained in detail
            below.]

        - *The initial and final lines have special trimming behavior*

          For the initial line, if all characters following the initial backticks or
          language tag are whitespace, the entire line will be trimmed. However, if
          there are non-whitespace characters on that line, only a single space
          immediately following the initial backticks or language tag will be
          trimmed if present.

          If the final line is entirely whitespace up to the closing backticks, it
          will be trimmed. Otherwise, if the last non-whitespace character of the
          final line is a backtick, then one space character will be trimmed from
          the end of the line if present.

        - *Common indentation at the beginning of lines is trimmed*

          Typst will remove initial whitespace at the beginning of lines in the raw
          text that is shared between all lines, i.e. common indentation. Although
          this excludes text on the line with the initial backticks.

          Typst first finds the line with the fewest initial whitespace characters
          that contains some non-whitespace characters, including the line with the
          closing backticks. Then Typst trims characters from every line equal to
          the number of initial whitespace characters in that line. Lines which are
          only whitespace will remove the same number of characters until they are
          empty, but will keep any extra trailing whitespace.

          #let code-point = "https://www.unicode.org/glossary/#code_point"

          Note that this check treats tabs and spaces as equivalent characters for
          simplicity, and that it operates on numbers of #link(code-point)[Unicode
            code points], i.e. characters, not on byte lengths.

        These properties of the three-plus backtick syntax allow for some use cases
        that may not be obvious:

        - To write text containing a sequence of backticks, enclose it with one or
          more backticks than the sequence:
          ````` ```` enclosed```backticks```` `````

        - To write text that starts or ends with a backtick, add a space inside the
          opening and closing backticks: ```` ``` `backticks` ``` ````

        - To write inline text highlighted with a language tag, add a space between
          the language tag and the text ````rust ```rust fn main() {}``` ````

        - To write inline text without any language tag, add a space after the
          initial backticks: ```` ``` text``` ```` or use the single backtick
          syntax: ``` `text` ```

        == Embedding strings with raw syntax <embedding-strings>
        A common use-case for raw syntax is to embed data as strings with formatting
        by accessing the `.text` field on raw content to get the underlying string.
        This may also be paired with the @bytes constructor to convert the string to
        bytes.

        ````example
        An inline YAML dictionary via `.text`

        #yaml(bytes(
          ```yaml
          Magic:
            limited-by: Mana
          Pokémon:
            limited-by: Energy
          Yu-Gi-Oh:
            limited-by: false
          ```.text
          //  ^^^^ used as a string
        ))
        ````

        == Language tag changes <language-tag-changes>

        When using raw syntax with three or more backticks, text immediately after
        the initial backticks (up to the first whitespace) is treated as a
        @raw.lang[language tag]. However in the current version of Typst, only text
        that would be a valid Typst identifier is treated as the language tag. The
        first character not valid for an identifier will be interpreted as starting
        the raw text.

        For example, in the current version of Typst, if a raw block starts with
        `C++`, the identifier `C` will be the language tag, and the raw text will
        start with `++`. If a raw block starts with `++C`, it will have no language
        tag and the raw text will start with `++C`.

        To use language tags that are not valid as identifiers in the current
        version of Typst, you must use the @raw.lang[`lang`] parameter, either by
        calling the constructor with a string: ```typ #raw("text", lang: "...")```,
        or by writing a set rule: ```typ #set raw(lang: "...")```.

        In the next version of Typst, _all text_ up to the first whitespace or
        backtick will be treated as the language tag, allowing a wider character set
        for language tags. Tags including spaces or backticks will still need to be
        set manually via the @raw.lang[`lang`] parameter.

        Typst will alert you if your raw blocks will be interpreted differently in
        the next Typst version by emitting a warning.

              sum += int(part.trim())
            }

          }

        Whether the raw text is displayed as a separate block.

        In markup mode, using one-backtick notation makes this `{false}`. Using
        three-backtick notation makes it `{true}` if the enclosed content
        contains at least one line break.

        ````example
        // Display inline code in a small box
        // that retains the correct baseline.
        #show raw.where(block: false): box.with(
