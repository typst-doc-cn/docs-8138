          Raw text with optional syntax highlighting.

          Displays the text verbatim and in a monospace font. This is typically used
          to embed computer code into a document.

          Text given to this element will ignore markup syntax, such as `[*strong*]`
          or `[_emphasis_]`, and will be displayed verbatim. If you would like to
          display content with a monospace font while still allowing markup syntax,
          instead of using @raw, you can explicitly set the text font to a monospace
          font with the @text.font parameter.

          Raw elements are mainly produced with their @raw:syntax[dedicated syntax] by
          enclosing text with either one or three-plus backtick characters (``` ` ```)
          on both sides. When using three or more backticks, text immediately after
          the initial backticks will be treated as a @raw.lang[language tag] used for
          syntax highlighting, and the raw text begins after the first whitespace.

          global font size). This is because monospace fonts tend to be visually

          This function has dedicated syntax that produces a raw element in both
          markup and code mode. You can enclose text in one or three-plus backtick
          characters (``` ` ```) on both sides to make it raw. The number of backticks
          must be the same on both sides, and the enclosed text cannot contain a group
          of that many backticks in a row. Writing just two backticks (``` `` ```)
          produces empty raw text.

          Notable differences from Markdown include that single backticks can enclose
          text spanning multiple lines without removing indentation, and that the
          three-plus backtick syntax still interprets language tags when used inline.

          Raw text enclosed in _single_ backticks has no way to specify a language tag
          and is always treated as inline for use within a paragraph, i.e. the
          @raw.block[`block`] parameter is `{false}`.

          Raw syntax using _three or more_ backticks has the following properties:

          - *After the initial backticks, the raw block is only terminated by a
            sequence of the same number of backticks*

            To include text containing a sequence of backticks, the initial and final
            backticks must have at least one more backtick than the sequence.

          - *If the raw text contains a linebreak, it will be block-level, otherwise
            it will be inline*

            This sets the @raw.block[`block`] parameter to `{true}` or `{false}`
            accordingly.

          - *Text immediately after the initial backticks, up to the first whitespace,
            is treated as a _language tag_ used for syntax highlighting*

            The specific rules for which text can be treated as the language tag are
            planned to change, and are @raw:language-tag-changes[explained in detail
              below.]

          - *The initial and final lines have special trimming behavior*

            For the initial line, if all characters following the initial backticks or
            language tag are whitespace, the entire line will be trimmed. However, if
            there are non-whitespace characters on that line, only a single space
            immediately following the initial backticks or language tag will be
            trimmed if present.

            If the final line is entirely whitespace up to the closing backticks, it
            will be trimmed. Otherwise, if the last non-whitespace character of the
            final line is a backtick, then one space character will be trimmed from
            the end of the line if present.

          - *Common indentation at the beginning of lines is trimmed*

            Typst will remove initial whitespace at the beginning of lines in the raw
            text that is shared between all lines, i.e. common indentation. Although
            this excludes text on the line with the initial backticks.

            Typst first finds the line with the fewest initial whitespace characters
            that contains some non-whitespace characters, including the line with the
            closing backticks. Then Typst trims characters from every line equal to
            the number of initial whitespace characters in that line. Lines which are
            only whitespace will remove the same number of characters until they are
            empty, but will keep any extra trailing whitespace.

            #let code-point = "https://www.unicode.org/glossary/#code_point"

            Note that this check treats tabs and spaces as equivalent characters for
            simplicity, and that it operates on numbers of #link(code-point)[Unicode
              code points], i.e. characters, not on byte lengths.

          These properties of the three-plus backtick syntax allow for some use cases
          that may not be obvious:

          - To write text containing a sequence of backticks, enclose it with one or
            more backticks than the sequence:
            ````` ```` enclosed```backticks```` `````

          - To write text that starts or ends with a backtick, add a space inside the
            opening and closing backticks: ```` ``` `backticks` ``` ````

          - To write inline text highlighted with a language tag, add a space between
            the language tag and the text ````rust ```rust fn main() {}``` ````

          - To write inline text without any language tag, add a space after the
            initial backticks: ```` ``` text``` ```` or use the single backtick
            syntax: ``` `text` ```

          When using raw syntax with three or more backticks, text immediately after
          the initial backticks (up to the first whitespace) is treated as a
          @raw.lang[language tag]. However in the current version of Typst, only text
          that would be a valid Typst identifier is treated as the language tag. The
          first character not valid for an identifier will be interpreted as starting
          the raw text.

          For example, in the current version of Typst, if a raw block starts with
          `C++`, the identifier `C` will be the language tag, and the raw text will
          start with `++`. If a raw block starts with `++C`, it will have no language
          tag and the raw text will start with `++C`.

          To use language tags that are not valid as identifiers in the current
          version of Typst, you must use the @raw.lang[`lang`] parameter, either by
          calling the constructor with a string: ```typ #raw("text", lang: "...")```,
          or by writing a set rule: ```typ #set raw(lang: "...")```.

          In the next version of Typst, _all text_ up to the first whitespace or
          backtick will be treated as the language tag, allowing a wider character set
          for language tags. Tags including spaces or backticks will still need to be
          set manually via the @raw.lang[`lang`] parameter.

          Typst will alert you if your raw blocks will be interpreted differently in
          the next Typst version by emitting a warning.
