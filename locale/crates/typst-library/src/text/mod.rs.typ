          A font family descriptor or priority list of font family descriptors.

          A font family descriptor can be a plain string representing the family
          name or a dictionary with the following keys:

          - `name` (required): The font family name.
          - `covers` (optional): Defines the Unicode codepoints for which the
            family shall be used. This can be:
            - A predefined coverage set:
              - `{"latin-in-cjk"}` covers all codepoints except for those which
                exist in Latin fonts, but should preferably be taken from CJK
                fonts.
            - A @regex[regular expression] that defines exactly which codepoints
              shall be covered. Accepts only the subset of regular expressions
              which consist of exactly one dot, letter, or character class.

          When processing text, Typst tries all specified font families in order
          until it finds a font that has the necessary glyphs. In the example
          below, the font `Inria Serif` is preferred, but since it does not
          contain Arabic glyphs, the arabic text uses `Noto Sans Arabic` instead.

          Typst aims to unify different fonts from the same family under a single
          family name. To that effect, it automatically trims common style
          suffixes like "Bold" or "Condensed" from font family names. Instead of
          selecting these through the name, access them through Typst's built-in
          mechanisms (such as the @text.weight[`weight`] and
          @text.stretch[`stretch`] parameters). Similarly, when using a variable
          font with Typst, the suffixes "Variable", "Var", and "VF" should be
          omitted as Typst trims them to unify static and variable fonts into a
          single family.

          Between fonts from the same family, Typst picks the one that is the
          closest match to the configured text @text.style[`style`],
          @text.weight[`weight`], and @text.stretch[`stretch`]. If both a static
          and a variable font support a specific configuration, the variable font
          is preferred.

          The collection of available fonts differs by platform:

          - In the web app, you can see the list of available fonts by clicking on
            the "Ag" button. You can provide additional fonts by uploading `.ttf`
            or `.otf` files into your project. They will be discovered
            automatically. The priority is: project fonts > server fonts.

          - Locally, Typst uses your installed system fonts or embedded fonts in
            the CLI, which are `Libertinus Serif`, `New Computer Modern`,
            `New Computer Modern Math`, and `DejaVu Sans Mono`. In addition, you
            can use the `--font-path` argument or `TYPST_FONT_PATHS` environment
            variable to add directories that should be scanned for fonts. The
            priority is: `--font-path` > system fonts > embedded fonts. Run
            `typst fonts` to see the fonts that Typst has discovered on your
            system. Note that you can pass the `--ignore-system-fonts` parameter
            to the CLI to ensure Typst won't search for system fonts.

          Setting the correct language affects various parts of Typst:

          - The text processing pipeline can make more informed choices.
          - Hyphenation will use the correct patterns for the language.
          - @smartquote[Smart quotes] turns into the correct quotes for the
            language.
          - And all other things which are language-aware.

          Choosing the correct language is important for accessibility. For
          example, screen readers will use it to choose a voice that matches the
          language of the text. If your document is in another language than
          English (the default), you should set the text language at the start of
          your document, before any other content. You can, for example, put it
          right after the `[#set document(/* ... */)]` rule that
          @document.title[sets your document's title].

          If your document contains passages in a different language than the main
          language, you should locally change the text language just for those
          parts, either with a set rule
          @reference:scripting:blocks[scoped to a block] or using a direct text
          function call such as `[#text(lang: "de")[...]]`.

          If multiple codes are available for your language, you should prefer the
          two-letter code (ISO 639-1) over the three-letter codes (ISO 639-2/3).
          When you have to use a three-letter code and your language differs

          export.

          the layout engine will make the choice less often. Costs are specified
          as a ratio of the default cost, so `{50%}` will make text layout twice
          as eager to make a given choice, while `{200%}` will make it half as
          eager.

          Currently, the following costs can be customized:
          - `hyphenation`: splitting a word across multiple lines
          - `runt`: ending a paragraph with a line with a single word
          - `widow`: leaving a single line of paragraph on the next page
          - `orphan`: leaving single line of paragraph on the previous page

          Hyphenation is generally avoided by placing the whole word on the next
          line, so a higher hyphenation cost can result in awkward justification
          spacing. Note: Hyphenation costs will only be applied when the
          @par.linebreaks[`linebreaks`] are set to "optimized". (For example by
          default implied by @par.justify[`justify`].)

          Runts are avoided by placing more or fewer words on previous lines, so a
          higher runt cost can result in more awkward in justification spacing.

          Text layout prevents widows and orphans by default because they are
          generally discouraged by style guides. However, in some contexts they
          are allowed because the prevention method, which moves a line to the
          next page, can result in an uneven number of lines between pages. The
          `widow` and `orphan` costs allow disabling these modifications.
          (Currently, `{0%}` allows widows/orphans; anything else, including the
          default of `{100%}`, prevents them. More nuanced cost specification for
          these modifications is planned for the future.)

          Raw OpenType font variations to apply.

          While classic static fonts require a separate font file for each style
          combination, variable fonts have _variation axes_ from which many
          different styles can be instanced. Variation axes are identified by
          case-sensitive four-letter strings.

          There are a few well-known variation axes, for which Typst will
          automatically set suitable values based on the text
          @text.weight[`weight`], @text.stretch[`stretch`], @text.style[`style`],
          and @text.size[`size`]. This includes:
          - `wght`: Weight (e.g., 400 for regular, 700 for bold)
          - `wdth`: Width (percentage, e.g., 100 for normal)
          - `slnt`: Slant (degrees, negative for right-leaning)
          - `ital`: Italic (0 for upright, 1 for italic)
          - `opsz`: Optical size (in points)

          Fonts can also define custom variation axes to realize arbitrary visual
          effects. For example, a font's appearance could become more whimsical
          the higher a particular axis value is set.

          With the `variations` parameter, you can directly set values for the
          axes supported by the active font. It only has an effect when used with
          a suitable variable font that supports the specified axes. You can use
          the parameter both to override automatically set values for the
          well-known axes and to set values for custom axes.

          The value should be a dictionary mapping axis tags (four-character
          @str[strings]) to their values (@float[floating-point numbers]).
