          Content consists of elements with fields. When constructing an element with
          its _element function,_ you provide these fields as arguments and when you
          have a content value, you can access its fields with
          @reference:scripting:fields[field access syntax].

          Some fields are required: These must be provided when constructing an
          element and as a consequence, they are always available through field access
          on content of that type. Required fields are marked as such in the
          documentation.

          Most fields are optional: Like required fields, they can be passed to the
          element function to configure them for a single element. However, these can
          also be configured with @reference:styling:set-rules[set rules] to apply
          them to all elements within a scope. Optional fields are only available with
          field access syntax when they were explicitly passed to the element
          function, not when they result from a set rule.

          Each element has a default appearance. However, you can also completely
          customize its appearance with a @reference:styling:show-rules[show rule].
          The show rule is passed the element. It can access the element's field and
          produce arbitrary content from it.

          In the web app, you can hover over a content variable to see exactly which
          elements the content is composed of and what fields they have.
          Alternatively, you can inspect the output of the @repr function.
