          Describes a kind of value.

          To style your document, you need to work with values of different kinds:
          Lengths specifying the size of your elements, colors for your text and
          shapes, and more. Typst categorizes these into clearly defined _types_ and
          tells you where it expects which type of value.

          Apart from basic types for numeric values and @int[typical] @float[types]
          @str[known] @array[from] @dictionary[programming] languages, Typst provides
          a special type for @content[_content._] A value of this type can hold
          anything that you can enter into your document: Text, elements like headings
          and shapes, and style information.

      #let x = 10
      #if type(x) == int [
        #x is an integer!
      ] else [
        #x is another value...
      ]

      An image is of type
      #type(image("glacier.jpg")).
      ```

          The type of `{10}` is `int`. Now, what is the type of `int` or even `type`?

          Unlike other types like `int`, @none[none] and @auto[auto] do not have a
          name representing them. To test if a value is one of these, compare your
          value to them directly, e.g:
