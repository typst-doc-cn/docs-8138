        A value that indicates the absence of any other value.

        The none type has exactly one value: `{none}`.

        When inserted into the document, it is not visible. This is also the value
        that is produced by empty code blocks. It can be
        @reference:scripting:blocks[joined] with any value, yielding the other
        value.
