        Returns the string representation of a value.

        When inserted into content, most values are displayed as this representation
        in monospace with syntax-highlighting. The exceptions are `{none}`,
        integers, floats, strings, content, and functions.

        = Example <example>
        ```example
        #none vs #repr(none) \
        #"hello" vs #repr("hello") \
        #(1, 2) vs #repr((1, 2)) \
        #[*Hi*] vs #repr([*Hi*])
        ```

        = #short-or-long[Debugging Only][For debugging purposes only] <debugging-only>
        This function is for debugging purposes. Its output should not be considered
        stable and may change at any time.

        To be specific, having the same `repr` does not guarantee that values are
        equivalent, and `repr` is not a strict inverse of @eval. In the following
        example, for readability, the @length is rounded to two significant digits
        and the parameter list and body of the @function:unnamed[unnamed `function`]
        are omitted.

        ```example
        #assert(2pt / 3 < 0.67pt)
        #repr(2pt / 3)

        #repr(x => x + 1)
        ```
