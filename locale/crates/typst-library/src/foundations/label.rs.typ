          A label for an element.

          Inserting a label into content attaches it to the closest preceding element
          that is not a space. The preceding element must be in the same scope as the
          label, which means that `[Hello #[<label>]]`, for instance, wouldn't work.

          A labelled element can be @ref[referenced], @query[queried] for, and
          @reference:styling[styled] through its label.

          Once constructed, you can get the name of a label using
          @str.constructor[`str`].

          This function also has dedicated syntax: You can create a label by enclosing
          its name in angle brackets. This works both in markup and code. A label's
          name can contain letters, numbers, `_`, `-`, `:`, and `.`. A label cannot be
          empty.

          Note that there is a syntactical difference when using the dedicated syntax
          for this function. In the code below, the `[<a>]` terminates the heading and
          thus attaches to the heading itself, whereas the `[#label("b")]` is part of
          the heading and thus attaches to the heading's text.
