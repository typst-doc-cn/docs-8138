            complement] representation in 64 bits. This allows storing numbers up to
          $2^63-1$ (@int.max), and down to $-2^63$ (@int.min).

          Integers can also be specified as hexadecimal, octal, or binary by starting
          with the prefixes: `0x`, `0o`, or `0b`.

          Typst integers can be entered in code mode using the decimal digits 0--9. In
          addition, if a lone digit 0 is followed by `x`, `o`, or `b` (`0x`, `0o`,
          `0b`), Typst will treat following digits as a
          #wiki("Hexadecimal")[hexadecimal] (base 16), #wiki("Octal")[octal] (base 8),
          or #wiki("Binary_number")[binary] (base 2) number.

          Hexadecimal numbers use the letters a--f or A--F for the values 10--15.

          Typst will error if an integer is written that is larger than @int.max. If
          this happens, you may want to use a @float[floating point number] instead by
          appending a period to the end of the number.

          Typst differs from some other programming languages by not treating negative
          integers as individual tokens in its syntax. Instead, input like `{-6}` is
          treated as the negation operator applied to the positive integer `6`. This
          may cause an issue when trying to write the minimum negative integer
          `{-9223372036854775808}`, as `{9223372036854775808}` is larger than
          @int.max. To write the minimum negative integer, use @int.min instead.

          This also means that if you want to embed a negative integer in markup, you
          will need to use parentheses to group the negation operator: `[#(-6)]`.
