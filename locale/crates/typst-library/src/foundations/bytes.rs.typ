          A sequence of bytes.

          This is conceptually similar to an array of @int[integers] between `{0}` and
          `{255}`, but represented much more efficiently. You can iterate over it
          using a @reference:scripting:loops[for loop].

          You can convert
          - a @str[string] or an @array[array] of integers to bytes with the @bytes
            constructor
          - bytes to a string with the @str constructor, with UTF-8 encoding
          - bytes to an array of integers with the @array constructor

          When @read[reading] data from a file, you can decide whether to load it as a
          string or as raw bytes.
