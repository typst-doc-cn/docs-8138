        A filter for selecting elements within the document.

        To construct a selector you can:
        - use an @function:element-functions[element function]
        - filter for an element function with @function.where[specific fields]
        - use a @str[string] or @regex[regular expression]
        - use a @label[`{<label>}`]
        - use a @location
        - call the @selector constructor to convert any of the above types into a
          selector value and use the methods below to refine it

        Selectors are used to @reference:styling:show-rules[apply styling rules] to
        elements. You can also use selectors to @query[query] the document for
        certain types of elements.

        Furthermore, you can pass a selector to several of Typst's built-in
        functions to configure their behaviour. One such example is the
        @outline[outline] where it can be used to change which elements are listed
        within the outline.

        Multiple selectors can be combined using the methods shown below. However,
        not all kinds of selectors are supported in all places, at the moment.

        = Example <example>
        ```example
        #context query(
          heading.where(level: 1)
            .or(heading.where(level: 2))
        )

        = This will be found
        == So will this
        === But this will not.

  "Selector::within": (

    babel(
      en: [
        Returns a modified selector that will only match elements that are
        contained within any elements matching the `ancestor` selector.

        #example(
          title: "Finding strong elements in lists",
          ```
          *Strong emphasis* that does not count.

          - An *important* word
          - Another *key* word

          Strong elements in lists:
          #context {
            query(selector(strong).within(list))
              .map(it => it.body)
              .join[, ]
          }
          ```,
        )

        This can also be used in combination with @here to find all matches of a
        selector within a @reference:context[context] expression. This can be
        quite useful to have an introspection return results local to some
        component you are building.

        #example(
          title: "Counting elements locally in a context block",
          ```
          #let count(sel, body) = context {
            let n = query(selector(sel).within(here())).len()
            [#body (#n matches)]
          }

          - #count(emph)[Has _two_ matching _elements_]
          - #count(strong)[Has *one* matching element]
          ```,
        )

        functions, not in show rules.
