          You can specify a customized formatting using the
          @datetime.display[`display`] method. The format of a datetime is specified
          by providing _components_ with a specified number of _modifiers_. A
          component represents a certain part of the datetime that you want to
          display, and with the help of modifiers you can define how you want to
          display that component. In order to display a component, you wrap the name
          of the component in square brackets (e.g. `[[year]]` will display the year).
          In order to add modifiers, you add a space after the component name followed
          by the name of the modifier, a colon and the value of the modifier (e.g.
          `[[month repr:short]]` will display the short representation of the month).

          The possible combination of components and their respective modifiers is as
          follows:

          - `year`: Displays the year of the datetime.
            - `base`: Can be either `calendar` or `iso_week`. Specifies whether the
              year is based on the Gregorian calendar or the ISO week number.
            - `padding`: Can be either `zero`, `space` or `none`. Specifies how the
              year is padded.
            - `repr` Can be either `full` in which case the full year is displayed or
              `last_two` in which case only the last two digits are displayed.
            - `sign`: Can be either `automatic` or `mandatory`. Specifies when the
              sign should be displayed.
          - `month`: Displays the month of the datetime.
            - `padding`: Can be either `zero`, `space` or `none`. Specifies how the
              month is padded.
            - `repr`: Can be either `numerical`, `long` or `short`. Specifies if the
              month should be displayed as a number or a word. Unfortunately, when
              choosing the word representation, it can currently only display the
              English version. In the future, it is planned to support localization.
          - `day`: Displays the day of the datetime.
            - `padding`: Can be either `zero`, `space` or `none`. Specifies how the
              day is padded.
          - `week_number`: Displays the week number of the datetime.
            - `padding`: Can be either `zero`, `space` or `none`. Specifies how the
              week number is padded.
            - `repr`: Can be either `ISO`, `sunday` or `monday`. In the case of `ISO`,
              week numbers are between 1 and 53, while the other ones are between 0
              and 53.
          - `weekday`: Displays the weekday of the date.
            - `repr` Can be either `long`, `short`, `sunday` or `monday`. In the case
              of `long` and `short`, the corresponding English name will be displayed
              (same as for the month, other languages are currently not supported). In
              the case of `sunday` and `monday`, the numerical value will be displayed
              (assuming Sunday and Monday as the first day of the week, respectively).
            - `one_indexed`: Can be either `true` or `false`. Defines whether the
              numerical representation of the week starts with 0 or 1.
          - `hour`: Displays the hour of the date.
            - `padding`: Can be either `zero`, `space` or `none`. Specifies how the
              hour is padded.
            - `repr`: Can be either `24` or `12`. Changes whether the hour is
              displayed in the 24-hour or 12-hour format.
          - `period`: The AM/PM part of the hour
            - `case`: Can be `lower` to display it in lower case and `upper` to
              display it in upper case.
          - `minute`: Displays the minute of the date.
            - `padding`: Can be either `zero`, `space` or `none`. Specifies how the
              minute is padded.
          - `second`: Displays the second of the date.
            - `padding`: Can be either `zero`, `space` or `none`. Specifies how the
              second is padded.

          for more details on the supported syntax.

          Keep in mind that not always all components can be used. For example, if you
          create a new datetime with `{datetime(year: 2023, month: 10, day: 13)}`, it
          will be stored as a plain date internally, meaning that you cannot use
          components such as `hour` or `minute`, which would only work on datetimes
          that have a specified time.
