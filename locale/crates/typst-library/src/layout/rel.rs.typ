        A length in relation to some known length.

        This type is a combination of a @length[length] with a @ratio[ratio]. It
        results from addition and subtraction of a length and a ratio. Wherever a
        relative length is expected, you can also use a bare length or ratio.

        = Relative to the page <relative-to-the-page>
        A common use case is setting the width or height of a layout element (e.g.,
        @block[block], @rect[rect], etc.) as a certain percentage of the width of
        the page. Here, the rectangle's width is set to `{25%}`, so it takes up one
        fourth of the page's _inner_ width (the width minus margins).

        ```example
        #rect(width: 25%)
        ```

        Bare lengths or ratios are always valid where relative lengths are expected,
        but the two can also be freely mixed:

        ```example
        #rect(width: 25% + 1cm)
        ```

        For contents in the page @page.background[`background`] and
        @page.foreground[`foreground`], relative lengths are resolved against the
        page size including @page.bleed[`bleed`]. This choice is made for
        convenience, as creating a proper bleed-aware background inherently requires
        extending it into the bleed area.

        If you're trying to size an element so that it takes up the page's _full_
        width, you have a few options (this highly depends on your exact use case):

        + Set page margins to `{0pt}` (`[#set page(margin: 0pt)]`)
        + Multiply the ratio by the known full page width (`{21cm * 69%}`)
        + Use padding which will negate the margins (`[#pad(x: -2.5cm, ...)]`)
        + Use the page @page.background[`background`] or
          @page.foreground[`foreground`] field as those don't take margins into
          account (note that it will render the content outside of the document
          flow, see @place to control the content position)

        = Relative to a container <relative-to-a-container>
        When a layout element (e.g. a @rect[rect]) is nested in another layout
        container (e.g. a @block[block]) instead of being a direct descendant of the
        page, relative widths become relative to the container:

        ```example
        #block(
          width: 100pt,
          fill: aqua,
          rect(width: 50%),
        )
        ```

        = Scripting <scripting>
        You can multiply relative lengths by @ratio[ratios], @int[integers], and
        @float[floats].

        A relative length has the following fields:
        - `length`: Its @length[length] component.
        - `ratio`: Its @ratio[ratio] component.

        ```example
        #(100% - 50pt).length \
        #(100% - 50pt).ratio
        ```
      ],
    ),
  ),
)
