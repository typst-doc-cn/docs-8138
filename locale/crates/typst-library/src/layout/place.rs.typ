          Places content relatively to its parent container.

          Placed content can be either overlaid (the default) or floating. Overlaid
          content is aligned with the parent container according to the given
          @place.alignment[`alignment`], and shown over any other content added so far
          in the container. Floating content is placed at the top or bottom of the
          container, displacing other content down or up respectively. In both cases,
          the content position can be adjusted with @place.dx[`dx`] and
          @place.dy[`dy`] offsets without affecting the layout.

          The parent can be any container such as a @block, @box, @rect, etc. A top
          level `place` call will place content directly in the text area of the
          current page. This can be used for absolute positioning on the page: with a
          `top + left` @place.alignment[`alignment`], the offsets `dx` and `dy` will
          set the position of the element's top left corner relatively to the top left
          corner of the text area. For absolute positioning on the full page including
          margins, you can use `place` in @page.foreground or @page.background.

          Overlaid elements don't take space in the flow of content, but a `place`
          call inserts an invisible block-level element in the flow. This can affect
          the layout by breaking the current paragraph. To avoid this, you can wrap
          the `place` call in a @box when the call is made in the middle of a
          paragraph. The alignment and offsets will then be relative to this zero-size
          box. To make sure it doesn't interfere with spacing, the box should be
          attached to a word using a word joiner.

          For example, the following defines a function for attaching an annotation to
          the following word:

      ```example

        box(place(..args))
        sym.wj
        h(0pt, weak: true)
      }

      A placed #annotate(square(), dy: 2pt)
      square in my text.
