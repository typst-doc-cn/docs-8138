        A size or distance, possibly expressed with contextual units.

        Typst supports the following length units:

        - Points: `{72pt}`
        - Millimeters: `{254mm}`
        - Centimeters: `{2.54cm}`
        - Inches: `{1in}`
        - Relative to font size: `{2.5em}`

        You can multiply lengths with and divide them by integers and floats.

        = Example <example>
        ```example
        #rect(width: 20pt)
        #rect(width: 2em)
        #rect(width: 1in)

        #(3em + 5pt).em \
        #(20pt).em \
        #(40em + 2pt).abs \
        #(5em).abs
        ```

        = Fields <fields>
        - `abs`: A length with just the absolute component of the current length
          (that is, excluding the `em` component).
        - `em`: The amount of `em` units in this length, as a @float[float].
