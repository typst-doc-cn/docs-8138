        An inline-level container that sizes content.

        All elements except inline math, text, and boxes are block-level and cannot
        occur inside of a @par[paragraph]. The box function can be used to integrate
        such elements into a paragraph. Boxes take the size of their contents by
        default but can also be @box.width[sized] explicitly.

        Similarly to blocks, boxes can be used to @box.clip[clip] content or to give
        it a @box.fill[background] or @box.stroke[border]. However, they should only
        be used for these purposes if the resulting container is used in an
        inline-level context. Otherwise, a @block is preferable.

        = Example <example>
        ```example
        Refer to the docs
        #box(
          height: 9pt,
          image("docs.svg")
        )

        Boxes can have @fraction[fractional] widths, as the example below
        demonstrates.

        _Note:_ Currently, only boxes and only their widths might be
        fractionally sized within paragraphs. Support for fractionally sized
        images, shapes, and more might be added in the future.

        ```example
        Line in #box(width: 1fr, line(length: 100%)) between.
        ```

  "BoxElem::baseline": (

    babel(
      en: [
        The vertical position of the box's baseline. This is used to align the
        box with the text surrounding it in a paragraph, as the baseline is
        meant to go right below text by default.

        By default, the box's baseline will match the baseline of its contents
        (for example, of the text or equation inside it) - this is the `{auto}`
        option. However, the baseline can be adjusted in two ways. The first one
        is to simply pick a vertical @alignment[alignment], such as `{top}`,
        `{horizon}` or `{bottom}`, to place the baseline at that position,
        relative to the total height of the box (including inset).

        The other way to adjust it is to shift the default baseline vertically
        by some amount, specified as a @relative[relative length]. For example,
        a value of `{2pt}` will move it up by that exact length (causing the
        contents to go _down_, as the alignment point moves _up_), whereas
        `{-40%}` will shift the baseline _down_ by 40% of the box's total
        height, including inset (thus causing the contents to move _up_).

        Both options can be specified at the same time through a dictionary with
        the keys `at` and `shift`, respectively. For example, when specifying
        `{(at: bottom, shift: 10pt)}`, the box's baseline will be set to the
        height exactly `{10pt}` above the bottom of its contents.

        ```example
        Image: #box(baseline: 40%, image("tiger.jpg", width: 2cm)).

        This can be a single length for all sides or a dictionary of lengths for
        individual sides. When passing a dictionary, it can contain the
        following keys in order of precedence: `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`
        (controlling the respective cell sides), `x`, `y` (controlling vertical
        and horizontal insets), and `rest` (covers all insets not styled by
        other dictionary entries). All keys are optional; omitted keys will use
        their previously set value, or the default value if never set.

        @relative[Relative lengths] for this parameter are relative to the box
        size excluding @box.outset[outset]. Note that relative insets and
        outsets are different from relative @box.width[widths] and
        @box.height[heights], which are relative to the container.

        _Note:_ When the box contains text, its exact size depends on the
        current @text.top-edge[text edges].

        #rect(inset: 0pt)[Tight]

        relative to the box size excluding outset. See the documentation for
        @box.inset[inset] above for further details.

        This is useful to prevent padding from affecting line layout. For a

        Clipping is useful when the box's content is larger than the box itself,
        as any content that exceeds the box's bounds will be hidden.

        ```example

        @block.clip[clip] it, or to give it a @block.fill[background] or
        @block.stroke[border].

        Blocks are also the primary way to control whether text becomes part of a
        paragraph or not. See
        @par:what-becomes-a-paragraph[the paragraph documentation] for more details.

        = Examples <examples>
        With a block, you can give a background to content while still allowing it
        to break across multiple pages.

        ```example
        #set page(height: 100pt)
        #block(
          fill: luma(230),

          lorem(30),
        )
        ```

        Blocks are also useful to force elements that would otherwise be inline to
        become block-level, especially when writing show rules.

        ```example
        #show heading: it => it.body
        = Blockless
        More text.

        #show heading: it => block(it.body)

        For two adjacent blocks, the larger of the first block's `below` and the
        second block's `above` spacing wins. Moreover, block spacing takes

        Note that this is only a shorthand to set `above` and `below` to the
