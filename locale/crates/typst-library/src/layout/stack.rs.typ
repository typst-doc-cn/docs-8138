        Arranges content and spacing horizontally or vertically.

        The stack places a list of items along an axis, with optional spacing
        between each item.

        ```example
        #stack(
          dir: ttb,
          rect(width: 40pt),
          rect(width: 120pt),
          rect(width: 90pt),
        )
        ```

        Stacks do not carry any special semantics. The contents of the stack are
        read by Assistive Technology (AT) in the order in which they have been
        passed to this function.

        The direction along which the items are stacked. Possible values are:

        - `{ltr}`: Left to right.
        - `{rtl}`: Right to left.
        - `{ttb}`: Top to bottom.
        - `{btt}`: Bottom to top.

        You can use the `start` and `end` methods to obtain the initial and
        final points (respectively) of a direction, as `alignment`. You can also
        use the `axis` method to determine whether a direction is
        `{"horizontal"}` or `{"vertical"}`. The `inv` method returns a
        direction's inverse direction.

        For example, `{ttb.start()}` is `top`, `{ttb.end()}` is `bottom`,
        `{ttb.axis()}` is `{"vertical"}` and `{ttb.inv()}` is equal to `btt`.
