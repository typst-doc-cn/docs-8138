        Inserts horizontal spacing into a paragraph.

        The spacing can be absolute, relative, or fractional. In the last case, the
        remaining space on the line is distributed among all fractional spacings
        according to their relative fractions.

        = Example <example>
        ```example
        First #h(1cm) Second \
        First #h(30%) Second
        ```

        = Fractional spacing <fractional-spacing>
        With fractional spacing, you can align things within a line without forcing
        a paragraph break (like @align would). Each fractionally sized element gets
        space based on the ratio of its fraction to the sum of all fractions.

        ```example
        First #h(1fr) Second \
        First #h(1fr) Second #h(1fr) Third \
        First #h(2fr) Second #h(1fr) Third
        ```

        = #short-or-long[Math Spacing][Mathematical Spacing] <math-spacing>
        In @math[mathematical formulas], you can additionally use these constants to
        add spacing between elements: `thin` (1/6 em), `med` (2/9 em), `thick`
        (5/18 em), `quad` (1 em), `wide` (2 em).

        If `{true}`, the spacing collapses at the start or end of a paragraph.
        Moreover, from multiple adjacent weak spacings all but the largest one
        collapse.

        Weak spacing in markup also causes all adjacent markup spaces to be
        removed, regardless of the amount of spacing inserted. To force a space
        next to weak spacing, you can explicitly write `[#" "]` (for a normal
        space) or `[~]` (for a non-breaking space). The latter can be useful to
        create a construct that always attaches to the preceding word with one
        non-breaking space, independently of whether a markup space existed in
        front or not.

        ```example
        #h(1cm, weak: true)
        We identified a group of _weak_
        specimens that fail to manifest
        in most cases. However, when
        #h(8pt, weak: true) supported
        #h(8pt, weak: true) on both sides,
        they do show up.

        Further #h(0pt, weak: true) more,
        even the smallest of them swallow
        adjacent markup spaces.
