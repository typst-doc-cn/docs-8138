        Hides content without affecting layout.

        The `hide` function allows you to hide content while the layout still "sees"
        it. This is useful for creating blank space that is exactly as large as some
        content.

        = Example <example>
        ```example
        Hello Jane \
        #hide[Hello] Joe
        ```

        = Redaction <redaction>
        This function may also be useful for redacting content as its arguments are
        neither present visually nor accessible to Assistive Technology. That said,
        there can be _some_ traces of the hidden content (such as a bookmarked
        heading in the PDF's Document Outline).

        Note that, depending on the circumstances, it may be possible for content to
        be reverse engineered based on its size in the layout. We thus do not
        recommend using this function to hide highly sensitive information.
