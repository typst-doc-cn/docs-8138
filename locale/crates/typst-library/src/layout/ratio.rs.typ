        A ratio of a whole.

        A ratio is written as a number, followed by a percent sign. Ratios most
        often appear as part of a @relative[relative length], to specify the size of
        some layout element relative to the page or some container.

        ```example
        #rect(width: 25%)
        ```

        However, they can also describe any other property that is relative to some
        base, e.g. an amount of @scale.x[horizontal scaling] or the
        @math.lr.size[height of parentheses] relative to the height of the content
        they enclose.

        Within your own code, you can use ratios as you like. You can multiply them
        with various other types as shown below:

        #docs-table(
          table.header[Multiply by][Example][Result],

          [@ratio],
          [`{27% * 10%}`],
          [`{2.7%}`],

          [@length],
          [`{27% * 100pt}`],
          [`{27pt}`],

          [@relative],
          [`{27% * (10% + 100pt)}`],
          [`{2.7% + 27pt}`],

          [@angle],
          [`{27% * 100deg}`],
          [`{27deg}`],

          [@int],
          [`{27% * 2}`],
          [`{54%}`],

          [@float],
          [`{27% * 0.37037}`],
          [`{10%}`],

          [@fraction],
          [`{27% * 3fr}`],
          [`{0.81fr}`],
        )

        When ratios are @repr[displayed] in the document, they are rounded to two
        significant digits for readability.
