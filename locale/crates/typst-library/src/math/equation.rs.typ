        A mathematical equation.

        Can be displayed inline with text or as a separate block. An equation
        becomes block-level through the presence of whitespace after the opening
        dollar sign and whitespace before the closing dollar sign.

        = Example <example>
        ```example
        #set text(font: "New Computer Modern")

        Let $a$, $b$, and $c$ be the side
        lengths of a right-angled triangle.
        Then, we know that:
        $ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $

        Prove by induction:
        $ sum_(k=1)^n k = (n(n+1)) / 2 $
        ```

        By default, block-level equations will not break across pages. This can be
        changed through `{show math.equation: set block(breakable: true)}`.

        = Syntax <syntax>
        This function also has dedicated syntax: Write mathematical markup within
        dollar signs to create an equation. Starting and ending the equation with
        whitespace lifts it into a separate block that is centered horizontally. For
        more details about math syntax, see the @math[main math page].

        By default, the alignment is `{end + horizon}`. For the horizontal
        component, you can use `{right}`, `{left}`, or `{start}` and `{end}` of
        the text direction; for the vertical component, you can use `{top}`,
