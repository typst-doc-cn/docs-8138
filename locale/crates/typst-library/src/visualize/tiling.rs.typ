          A repeating tiling fill.

          Typst supports the most common type of tilings, where a pattern is repeated
          in a grid-like fashion, covering the entire area of an element that is
          filled or stroked. The pattern is defined by a tile
          @tiling.constructor.size[`size`] and a body defining the content of each
          cell. You can also add horizontal or vertical
          @tiling.constructor.spacing[`spacing`] between the cells of the tiling.
          The @tiling.constructor.offset[`offset`] and
          @tiling.constructor.angle[`angle`] determine the placement of the tiling.

          Tilings are also supported on text, but only when setting
          @tiling.constructor.relative[`relative`] to either `{auto}` (the default
          value) or `{"parent"}`. To create word-by-word or glyph-by-glyph tilings,
          you can wrap the words or characters of your text in @box[boxes] manually or
          through a @reference:styling:show-rules[show rule].

          The offset is specified as a `(x, y)` pair. Positive `x` values move
          the pattern to the right and positive `y` values move it down.
          Relative values are resolved against the tile size plus spacing.

          Note that the displacement caused by the offset affects the tiles
          themselves while displacement of the inner contents (e.g. via
          `{place(dx: .., dy: ..)}`) can cause clipping when the content
          moves outside of the tile's bounding box.
