          You can create a simple solid stroke from a color, a thickness, or a
          combination of the two. Specifically, wherever a stroke is expected you can
          pass any of the following values:

          - A length specifying the stroke's thickness. The color is inherited,
            defaulting to black.
          - A color to use for the stroke. The thickness is inherited, defaulting to
            `{1pt}`.
          - A stroke combined from color and thickness using the `+` operator as in
            `{2pt + red}`.

          For full control, you can also provide a @dictionary[dictionary] or a
          `{stroke}` object to any function that expects a stroke. The dictionary's
          keys may include any of the parameters for the constructor function, shown
          below.
