        A color gradient.

        Typst supports linear gradients through the
        @gradient.linear[`gradient.linear` function], radial gradients through the
        @gradient.radial[`gradient.radial` function], and conic gradients through
        the @gradient.conic[`gradient.conic` function].

        A gradient can be used for the following purposes:
        - As a fill to paint the interior of a shape:
          `{rect(fill: gradient.linear(..))}`
        - As a stroke to paint the outline of a shape:
          `{rect(stroke: 1pt + gradient.linear(..))}`
        - As the fill of text: `{set text(fill: gradient.linear(..))}`
        - As a color map you can @gradient.sample[sample] from:
          `{gradient.linear(..).sample(50%)}`

        = Examples <examples>
        ```example
        >>> #set square(size: 50pt)
        #stack(
          dir: ltr,
          spacing: 1fr,
          square(fill: gradient.linear(..color.map.rainbow)),
          square(fill: gradient.radial(..color.map.rainbow)),
          square(fill: gradient.conic(..color.map.rainbow)),
        )
        ```

        Gradients are also supported on text, but only when setting the
        @gradient.relative[relativeness] to either `{auto}` (the default value) or
        `{"parent"}`. To create word-by-word or glyph-by-glyph gradients, you can
        wrap the words or characters of your text in @box[boxes] manually or through
        a @reference:styling:show-rules[show rule].

        ```example
        >>> #set page(width: auto, height: auto, margin: 12pt)
        >>> #set text(size: 12pt)
        #set text(fill: gradient.linear(red, blue))
        #let rainbow(content) = {
          set text(fill: gradient.linear(..color.map.rainbow))
          box(content)
        }

        This is a gradient on text, but with a #rainbow[twist]!
        ```

        = Stops <stops>
        A gradient is composed of a series of stops. Each of these stops has a color
        and an offset. The offset is a @ratio[ratio] between `{0%}` and `{100%}` or
        an angle between `{0deg}` and `{360deg}`. The offset is a relative position
        that determines how far along the gradient the stop is located. The stop's
        color defines the color the gradient should have at that position.

        Each stop is passed as a positional argument and can take one of two forms:
        - Just a color, like `{red}`, to let Typst place the stop automatically.
        - An array of a color and its offset, like `{(red, 30%)}`, to place the stop
          yourself.

        You can choose to omit the offsets when defining a gradient. In this case,
        Typst will space all stops evenly. Otherwise, offsets must be provided for
        _every_ stop. They must not decrease from one stop to the next, the first
        must be `{0%}`, and the last must be `{100%}`.

        ```example
        #rect(
          width: 100%,
          fill: gradient.linear(
            (green, 0%),
            (red, 30%),
            (blue, 100%),
          ),
        )
        ```

        Giving two stops the same offset creates a hard edge instead of a smooth
        transition:

        ```example
        #rect(
          width: 100%,
          fill: gradient.linear(
            (orange, 0%),
            (orange, 50%),
            (blue, 50%),
            (blue, 100%),
          ),
        )
        ```

        Typst provides the @gradient.sharp[`sharp`] method on gradients to
        automatically turn a smooth gradient into one with hard edges. The
        example above can equivalently be written as:

        ```example
        #rect(
          width: 100%,
          fill: gradient.linear(orange, blue)
            .sharp(2),
        )
        ```

        Typst predefines color maps that you can use as stops. See the
        @color:predefined-color-maps[`color`] documentation for more details.

        = Relativeness <relativeness>
        The location of the `{0%}` and `{100%}` stops depends on the dimensions of a
        container. This container can either be the shape that it is being painted
        on, or the closest surrounding container. This is controlled by the
        `relative` argument of a gradient constructor. By default, gradients are
        relative to the shape they are being painted on, unless the gradient is
        applied on text, in which case they are relative to the closest ancestor
        container.

        Typst determines the ancestor container as follows:
        - For shapes that are placed at the root/top level of the document, the
          closest ancestor is the page itself.
        - For other shapes, the ancestor is the innermost @block or @box that
          contains the shape.

        = Color spaces and interpolation <color-spaces-and-interpolation>
        Gradients can be interpolated in any color space. By default, gradients are
        interpolated in the @color.oklab[Oklab] color space, which is a
        #link(
          "https://programmingdesignsystems.com/color/perceptually-uniform-color-spaces/index.html",
        )[perceptually uniform]
        color space. This means that the gradient will be perceived as having a
        smooth progression of colors. This is particularly useful for data
        visualization.

        However, you can choose to interpolate the gradient in any supported color
        space you want, but beware that some color spaces are not suitable for
        perceptually interpolating between colors. Consult the table below when
        choosing an interpolation space.

        #docs-table(
          table.header[Color space][Perceptually uniform?],

          [_No_],
        )

        ```preview
        >>> #set text(fill: white, font: "IBM Plex Sans", 8pt)
        >>> #set block(spacing: 0pt)
        #let spaces = (
          ("Oklab", color.oklab),
          ("Oklch", color.oklch),
          ("sRGB", color.rgb),
          ("linear-RGB", color.linear-rgb),
          ("CMYK", color.cmyk),
          ("Grayscale", color.luma),
          ("HSL", color.hsl),
          ("HSV", color.hsv),
        )

        #for (name, space) in spaces {
          block(
            width: 100%,
            inset: 4pt,
            fill: gradient.linear(
              red,
              blue,
              space: space,
            ),
            strong(upper(name)),
          )
        }
        ```

        = Direction <direction>
        Some gradients are sensitive to direction. For example, a linear gradient
        has an angle that determines its direction. Typst uses a clockwise angle,
        with 0° being from left to right, 90° from top to bottom, 180° from right to
        left, and 270° from bottom to top.

        ```example
        >>> #set square(size: 50pt)
        #stack(
          dir: ltr,
          spacing: 1fr,
          square(fill: gradient.linear(red, blue, angle: 0deg)),
          square(fill: gradient.linear(red, blue, angle: 90deg)),
          square(fill: gradient.linear(red, blue, angle: 180deg)),
          square(fill: gradient.linear(red, blue, angle: 270deg)),
        )
        ```

        = Note on file sizes <note-on-file-sizes>
        Gradients can be quite large, especially if they have many stops. This is
        because gradients are stored as a list of colors and offsets, which can take
        up a lot of space. In SVG export, gradients are stored as a list of
        @color.rgb colors replicating the original color space with an optimized
        number of extra stops in between. In PDF export, the same applies to
        gradients in the @color.oklab, @color.oklch, @color.hsv, @color.hsl, and
        @color.linear-rgb color spaces. This avoids needing to encode these color
        spaces in your PDF file, but it does add extra stops to your gradient, which
        can increase the file size.

        Creates a new radial gradient, in which colors radiate away from an
        origin.

        The gradient is defined by two circles: the focal circle and the end
        circle. The focal circle is a circle with center `focal-center` and
        radius `focal-radius`, that defines the points at which the gradient
        starts and has the color of the first stop. The end circle is a circle
        with center `center` and radius `radius`, that defines the points at
        which the gradient ends and has the color of the last stop. The gradient
        is then interpolated between these two circles.

        Using these four values, also called the focal point for the starting
        circle and the center and radius for the end circle, we can define a
        gradient with more interesting properties than a basic radial gradient.
