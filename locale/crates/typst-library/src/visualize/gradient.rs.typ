          A color gradient.

          Typst supports linear gradients through the
          @gradient.linear[`gradient.linear` function], radial gradients through the
          @gradient.radial[`gradient.radial` function], and conic gradients through
          the @gradient.conic[`gradient.conic` function].

          A gradient can be used for the following purposes:
          - As a fill to paint the interior of a shape:
            `{rect(fill: gradient.linear(..))}`
          - As a stroke to paint the outline of a shape:
            `{rect(stroke: 1pt + gradient.linear(..))}`
          - As the fill of text: `{set text(fill: gradient.linear(..))}`
          - As a color map you can @gradient.sample[sample] from:
            `{gradient.linear(..).sample(50%)}`
        ],
      )

      >>> #set square(size: 50pt)
      #stack(
        dir: ltr,

        square(fill: gradient.linear(..color.map.rainbow)),
        square(fill: gradient.radial(..color.map.rainbow)),

          @gradient.relative[relativeness] to either `{auto}` (the default value) or
          `{"parent"}`. To create word-by-word or glyph-by-glyph gradients, you can
          wrap the words or characters of your text in @box[boxes] manually or through
          a @reference:styling:show-rules[show rule].

      #let rainbow(content) = {

          A gradient is composed of a series of stops. Each of these stops has a color
          and an offset. The offset is a @ratio[ratio] between `{0%}` and `{100%}` or
          an angle between `{0deg}` and `{360deg}`. The offset is a relative position
          that determines how far along the gradient the stop is located. The stop's
          color defines the color the gradient should have at that position.

          Each stop is passed as a positional argument and can take one of two forms:
          - Just a color, like `{red}`, to let Typst place the stop automatically.
          - An array of a color and its offset, like `{(red, 30%)}`, to place the stop
            yourself.

          You can choose to omit the offsets when defining a gradient. In this case,
          Typst will space all stops evenly. Otherwise, offsets must be provided for
          _every_ stop. They must not decrease from one stop to the next, the first
          must be `{0%}`, and the last must be `{100%}`.

          The location of the `{0%}` and `{100%}` stops depends on the dimensions of a
          container. This container can either be the shape that it is being painted
          on, or the closest surrounding container. This is controlled by the
          `relative` argument of a gradient constructor. By default, gradients are
          relative to the shape they are being painted on, unless the gradient is
          applied on text, in which case they are relative to the closest ancestor
          container.

          Typst determines the ancestor container as follows:
          - For shapes that are placed at the root/top level of the document, the
            closest ancestor is the page itself.
          - For other shapes, the ancestor is the innermost @block or @box that
            contains the shape.

          @color.rgb colors replicating the original color space with an optimized
          number of extra stops in between. In PDF export, the same applies to
          gradients in the @color.oklab, @color.oklch, @color.hsv, @color.hsl, and
          @color.linear-rgb color spaces. This avoids needing to encode these color
