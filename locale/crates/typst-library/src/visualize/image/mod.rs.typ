        A raster or vector graphic.

        You can wrap the image in a @figure to give it a number and caption.

        Like most elements, images are _block-level_ by default and thus do not
        integrate themselves into adjacent paragraphs. To force an image to become
        inline, put it into a @box.

        = Example <example>
        ```example
        #figure(
          image("molecular.jpg", width: 80%),
          caption: [
            A step in the molecular testing
            pipeline of our lab.
          ],
        )
        ```

        = Clipping <clipping>
        You can wrap an image in a @block or @box #footnote[A box should only be
          used if the image shall be displayed inline as part of a paragraph.
          Otherwise, a block is preferable.] with negative @block.inset[`inset`] and
        `{clip: true}` to clip it. Note that the clipped parts are only visually
        hidden. The full image data is still embedded in the output (except when
        exporting to PNG). This approach is thus not suitable for redacting parts of
        an image.

        ```example
        #let lynx = image("lynx.jpg", height: 150pt, fit: "cover")
        #grid(
          columns: 2,
          column-gutter: 1fr,
          // The full image on the left.
          lynx,
          // Two cropped parts on the right: One cropped by 80pt
          // from the bottom and one cropped by 75pt from the top.
          stack(
            spacing: 5pt,
            block(lynx, clip: true, inset: (bottom: -80pt)),
            block(lynx, clip: true, inset: (top: -75pt)),
          )
        )
        ```

        A path to an image file or raw bytes making up an image in one of the
        supported @image.format[formats].

        Bytes can be used to specify raw pixel data in a row-major,
        left-to-right, top-to-bottom format.

        ```example
        #let original = read("diagram.svg")
        #let changed = original.replace(
          "#2B80FF", // blue
          green.to-hex(),
        )

        #image(bytes(original))
        #image(bytes(changed))
        ```

    ),
  ),
  "ImageElem::format": (
    103,
    babel(
      en: [
        The image's format.

        By default, the format is detected automatically. Typically, you thus
        only need to specify this when providing raw bytes as the
        @image.source[`source`] (even then, Typst will try to figure out the
        format automatically, but that's not always possible).

        Supported formats are `{"png"}`, `{"jpg"}`, `{"gif"}`, `{"svg"}`,
        `{"pdf"}`, `{"webp"}` as well as raw pixel data.

        Note that several restrictions apply when using PDF files as images:

        - When exporting to PDF, any PDF image file used must have a version
          equal to or lower than the
          @pdf.standard:pdf-versions[export target PDF version].
        - PDF files as images are currently not supported when exporting with a
          specific PDF standard, like PDF/A-3 or PDF/UA-1. In these cases, you
          can instead use SVGs to embed vector images.
        - The image file must not be password-protected.
        - Tags in your PDF image will not be preserved. Instead, you must
          provide an @image.alt[alternative description] to make the image
          accessible.

        When providing raw pixel data as the `source`, you must specify a
        dictionary with the following keys as the `format`:
        - `encoding` (@str[str]): The encoding of the pixel data. One of:
          - `{"rgb8"}` (three 8-bit channels: red, green, blue)
          - `{"rgba8"}` (four 8-bit channels: red, green, blue, alpha)
          - `{"luma8"}` (one 8-bit channel)
          - `{"lumaa8"}` (two 8-bit channels: luma and alpha)
        - `width` (@int[int]): The pixel width of the image.
        - `height` (@int[int]): The pixel height of the image.

        The pixel width multiplied by the height multiplied by the channel count
        for the specified encoding must then match the `source` data.

        ```example
        #image(
          read(
            "tetrahedron.svg",
            encoding: none,
          ),
          format: "svg",
          width: 2cm,
        )

        #image(
          bytes(range(16).map(x => x * 16)),
          format: (
            encoding: "luma8",
            width: 4,
            height: 4,
          ),
          width: 2cm,

        When the image is wrapped in a @figure, use this parameter rather than
        the @figure.alt[figure's `alt` parameter] to describe the image. The
        only exception to this rule is when the image and the other contents in
        the figure form a single semantic unit. In this case, use the figure's
        `alt` parameter to describe the entire composition and do not use this
        parameter.
