        Typst's PDF export format.

        PDF files focus on accurately describing documents visually, but also have
        facilities for annotating their structure. This hybrid approach makes them a
        good fit for document exchange: They render exactly the same on every
        device, but also support extraction of a document's content and structure
        (at least to an extent). Unlike PNG files, PDFs are not bound to a specific
        resolution. Hence, you can view them at any size without incurring a loss of
        quality.

        = Exporting as PDF <exporting-as-pdf>
        == Command Line <command-line>
        PDF is Typst's default export format. Running the `compile` or `watch`
        subcommand without specifying a format will create a PDF. When exporting to
        PDF, you have the following configuration options:

        - Which @pdf.standard[PDF standards] Typst should enforce conformance with
          by specifying `--pdf-standard` followed by one or multiple comma-separated
          standards. Valid standards are `1.4`, `1.5`, `1.6`, `1.7`, `2.0`, `a-1b`,
          `a-1a`, `a-2b`, `a-2u`, `a-2a`, `a-3b`, `a-3u`, `a-3a`, `a-4`, `a-4f`,
          `a-4e`, and `ua-1`. By default, Typst outputs PDF-1.7-compliant files.

        - You can disable PDF tagging completely with `--pdf-tagged=false`. By
          default, Typst will always write _Tagged PDF_ to provide a baseline level
          of accessibility. Using this flag, you can turn tags off. This will make
          your file inaccessible and prevent conformance with accessible conformance
          levels of PDF/A and all parts of PDF/UA.

        - Which pages to export by specifying `--pages` followed by a
          comma-separated list of numbers or dash-separated number ranges. Ranges
          can be half-open. Example: `2,3,7-9,11-`.

        == Web App <pdf:web-app>
        Click the quick download button at the top right to export a PDF with
        default settings. For further configuration, click "File" > "Export as" >
        "PDF" or click the downwards-facing arrow next to the quick download button
        and select "Export as PDF". When exporting to PDF, you have the following
        configuration options:

        - Which PDF standards Typst should enforce conformance with. By default,
          Typst outputs PDF-1.7-compliant files. You can choose the PDF version
          freely between 1.4 and 2.0. Valid additional standards are `A-1b`, `A-1a`,
          `A-2b`, `A-2u`, `A-2a`, `A-3b`. `A-3u`, `A-3a`, `A-4`, `A-4f`, `A-4e`, and
          `UA-1`.

        - Which pages to export. Valid options are "All pages", "Current page", and
          "Custom ranges". Custom ranges are a comma-separated list of numbers or
          dash-separated number ranges. Ranges can be half-open. Example:
          `2,3,7-9,11-`.

        = PDF-specific functionality <pdf-specific-functionality>
        Typst exposes PDF-specific functionality in the global `pdf` element. See
        below for the definitions and options it contains.

        This element contains some functions without a final API. They are designed
        to enhance accessibility for documents with complex tables. This includes
        @[`table-summary`], @pdf.header-cell[`header-cell`], and
        @pdf.data-cell[`data-cell`]. All of these functions will be removed in a
        future Typst release, either through integration into table functions or
        through full removal. You can enable these functions by passing `--features
a11y-extras` or setting the `TYPST_FEATURES` environment variable to
        `a11y-extras`. In the web app, these features are not available at this
        time.

  "PdfFormat::pages": (
    103,
    babel(
      en: [
        Specifies which ranges of pages should be included in the PDF. This can
        be:

        - `{none}` to export all pages.
        - A single page range.
        - An array of page ranges.

        A page range is one of:

        - A number that specifies exactly one page (page numbers start at one).
        - A dictionary with the keys `from` (indicating the start of a page
          range) and/or `to` (indicating the end of a page range). At least one
          of the keys must be present, and both the start and end numbers are
          inclusive. Thus the range `{(from: 1, to: 3)}`, is the list of pages
          `{(1, 2, 3)}`.

        Specifying a single page or page range:
        ```typ
        #set pdf(pages: 3)
        #set pdf(pages: (from: 3))
        #set pdf(pages: (to: 5))
        #set pdf(pages: (from: 3, to: 5))
        ```

        Specifying multiple pages, page ranges, or a mix:
        ```typ
        #set pdf(pages: (5, 7, 9))
        #set pdf(pages: ((to: 3), 5, (from: 7, to: 8), (from: 10)))
        ```

      en: [
        A list of PDF standards that Typst will enforce conformance with. This
        can be a single standard or an array of standards.

        The International Standards Organization (ISO) has published the base
        PDF standard and various standards that extend it to make PDFs more
        suitable for specific use-cases. By default, Typst exports PDF 1.7
        files. Adobe Acrobat 8 and later as well as all other commonly used PDF
        viewers are compatible with this PDF version.

        Some features of Typst may not be available depending on the PDF
        standard you choose. You can combine compatible PDF/A and PDF/UA
        standards. Notably, PDF/UA-1 and PDF/A-4 are mutually incompatible since
        the former requires PDF 1.7 or earlier and the latter requires PDF 2.0.

        = PDF versions <pdf-versions>
        Typst supports five different PDF versions: 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7
        (default), and 2.0. You can choose each of these versions for your
        document export. However, based on the features you used there may be a
        minimum version. Likewise, the standards you target can limit which
        versions you can choose (see below for more).

        Here is a list on how each new version improves over PDF 1.4 for Typst
        documents:

        - *PDF 1.5* (2003): Improved color management, text extraction, table
          accessibility, reflow, and emoji fonts
        - *PDF 1.6* (2004): More flexible links
        - *PDF 1.7* (2006): Allows @pdf.attach[attachments], improved reflow
        - *PDF 2.0* (2017): Improved both metadata and tag semantics for
          accessibility

        The software used to read your file must support your PDF version. Under
        normal circumstances, this poses no problem, but it can be a source of
        errors when working with older hardware. For general exchange, we
        recommend keeping the default PDF 1.7 setting or choosing PDF 2.0.

        When using PDF files as @image[images] in your document, the export PDF
        version must equal or exceed the image file versions.

        = PDF/UA <pdf-ua>
        Typst supports writing PDF/UA-conformant files. PDF/UA files are
        designed for _@guides:accessibility:basics[Universal Access]._ When you
        choose this PDF standard, Typst will run additional checks when
        exporting your document. These checks will make sure that you are
        following accessibility best practices. For example, it will make sure
        that all your images come with alternative descriptions.

        Note that there are some rules in PDF/UA that are crucial for
        accessibility but cannot be automatically checked. Hence, when exporting
        a PDF/UA-1 document, make sure you did the following:

        - If your document is written in a different language than English, make
          sure @text.lang[set the text language] before any content.
        - Make sure to use Typst's semantic elements (like @heading[headings],
          @figure[figures], and @list[lists]) when appropriate instead of
          defining custom constructs. This lets Typst know (and export) the role
          a construct plays in the document. See @guides:accessibility[the
            Accessibility guide] for more details.
        - Do not exclusively use contrast, color, format, or layout to
          communicate an idea. Use text or alternative descriptions instead of
          or in addition to these elements.
        - Wrap all decorative elements without a semantic meaning in
          @pdf.artifact.
        - Do not use images of text. Instead, insert the text directly into your
          markup.

        Typst currently only supports part one (PDF/UA-1) which is based on PDF
        1.7 (2006). When exporting to PDF/UA-1, be aware that you will need to
        manually provide @math:accessibility[alternative descriptions of
          mathematics] in natural language.

        New accessibility features were added to PDF 2.0 (2017). When set to PDF
        2.0 export, Typst will leverage some of these features. PDF 2.0 and
        PDF/UA-1, however, are mutually incompatible. For accessible documents,
        we currently recommend exporting to PDF/UA-1 instead of PDF 2.0 for the
        additional checks and greater compatibility. The second part of PDF/UA
        is designed for PDF 2.0, but not yet supported by Typst.

        = PDF/A <pdf-a>
        Typst optionally supports emitting PDF/A-conformant files. PDF/A files
        are geared towards maximum compatibility with current and future PDF
        tooling. They do not rely on difficult-to-implement or proprietary
        features and contain exhaustive metadata. This makes them suitable for
        long-term archival.

        The PDF/A Standard has multiple versions (_parts_ in ISO terminology)
        and most parts have multiple profiles that indicate the file's
        conformance level. You can target one part and conformance level at a
        time. Currently, Typst supports these PDF/A output profiles:

        - *PDF/A-1b:* The _basic_ conformance level of ISO 19005-1. This version
          of PDF/A is based on PDF 1.4 (2001) and results in self-contained,
          archivable PDF files. As opposed to later parts of the PDF/A standard,
          transparency is not allowed in PDF/A-1 files.

        - *PDF/A-1a:* This is the _accessible_ conformance level that builds on
          the basic level PDF/A-1b. To conform to this level, your file must be
          an accessible _Tagged PDF_ file. Note that accessibility is improved
          with later parts as not all PDF accessibility features are available
          for PDF 1.4 files. Furthermore, all text in the file must consist of
          known Unicode code points.

        - *PDF/A-2b:* The _basic_ conformance level of ISO 19005-2. This version
          of PDF/A is based on PDF 1.7 (2006) and results in self-contained,
          archivable PDF files.

        - *PDF/A-2u:* This is the _Unicode-mappable_ conformance level that
          builds on the basic level A-2b. It also adds rules that all text in
          the document must consist of known Unicode code points. If possible,
          always prefer this standard over PDF/A-2b.

        - *PDF/A-2a:* This is the _accessible_ conformance level that builds on
          the Unicode-mappable level A-2u. This conformance level also adds two
          requirements: Your file must be an accessible _Tagged PDF_ file. Typst
          automatically adds tags to help you reach this conformance level. Also
          pay attention to the Accessibility Sections throughout the reference
          and the @guides:accessibility[Accessibility Guide] when targeting this
          conformance level. Finally, PDF/A-2a forbids you from using code
          points in the
          #link("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Use_Areas")[Unicode
            Private Use area]. If you want to build an accessible file, also
          consider additionally targeting PDF/UA-1, which enables more automatic
          accessibility checks.

        - *PDF/A-3b:* The _basic_ conformance level of ISO 19005-3. This version
          of PDF/A is based on PDF 1.7 (2006) and results in archivable PDF
          files that can contain arbitrary other related files as
          @pdf.attach[attachments]. The only difference between it and PDF/A-2b
          is the capability to attach non-PDF/A-conformant files.

        - *PDF/A-3u:* This is the _Unicode-mappable_ conformance level that
          builds on the basic level A-3b. Just like PDF/A-2b, this requires all
          text to consist of known Unicode code points. These rules do not apply
          to attachments. If possible, always prefer this standard over
          PDF/A-3b.

        - *PDF/A-3a:* This is the _accessible_ conformance level that builds on
          the Unicode-mappable level A-3u. Just like PDF/A-2a, this requires
          files to be accessible _Tagged PDF_ and to not use characters from the
          Unicode Private Use area. Just like before, these rules do not apply
          to attachments.

        - *PDF/A-4:* The basic conformance level of ISO 19005-4. This version of
          PDF/A is based on PDF 2.0 (2017) and results in self-contained,
          archivable PDF files. PDF/A-4 has no parts relating to accessibility.
          Instead, the topic has been elaborated on more in the dedicated PDF/UA
          standard. PDF/A-4 files can conform to PDF/UA-2 (currently not
          supported in Typst).

        - *PDF/A-4f:* The _embedded files_ conformance level that builds on the
          basic level A-4. Files conforming to this level can contain arbitrary
          other related files as @pdf.attach[attachments], just as files
          conforming to part 3 of ISO 19005. The only difference between it and
          PDF/A-4 is the capability to attach non-PDF/A-conformant files.

        - *PDF/A-4e:* The _engineering_ conformance level that builds on the
          embedded files level A-4f. Files conforming to this level can contain
          3D objects. Typst does not support 3D content, so this is functionally
          equivalent to PDF/A-4f from a Typst perspective.

        If you want to target PDF/A but are unsure about which particular
        setting to use, there are some good rules of thumb. First, you must
        determine your *part,* that's the "version number" of the standard. Ask
        yourself these questions:

        + *Does pre-2006 software or equipment need to be able to read my file?*
          If so, choose part one (PDF/A-1).

        + *If not, does my file need @pdf.attach[attachments]?* If so, you must
          choose part three (PDF/A-3) or the embedded files level of part four
          (PDF/A-4f).

        + *Does your file need to use features introduced in PDF 2.0?*
          Currently, use of PDF 2.0 features in Typst is limited to minor
          improvements in accessibility, e.g. for the @title[title element]. If
          you can do without these improvements, maximize compatibility by
          choosing part two (when you don't need attachments) or part three
          (when you do need attachments). If you rely on PDF 2.0 features, use
          part four.

        Now, you only need to choose a *conformance level* (the lowercase letter
        at the end).

        - *If you decided on part one, two, or three,* you should typically
          choose the accessible conformance level of your part, indicated by a
          lowercase `a` at the end. If your document is inherently inaccessible,
          e.g. an artist's portfolio that cannot be boiled down to alternative
          descriptions, choose conformance level `u` instead. Only if this
          results in a compiler error, e.g. because you used code points from
          the Unicode Private Use Area, use the basic level `b`.

        - *If you have chosen part four,* you should choose the basic
          conformance level (PDF/A-4) except when needing to embed files.

        When choosing between exporting PDF/A and regular PDF, keep in mind that
        PDF/A files contain additional metadata, and that some readers will
        prevent the user from modifying a PDF/A file.

        This field is intended for instructions that help the user navigate the
        table using AT. It is not an alternative description, so do not duplicate
        the contents of the table within. Likewise, do not use this for the core
        takeaway of the table. Instead, include that in the text around the table
        or, even better, in a @figure.caption[figure caption].

        If in doubt whether your table is complex enough to warrant a summary, err
        on the side of not including one. If you are certain that your table is
        complex enough, consider whether a sighted user might find it challenging.

        Explicitly defines a cell as a header cell.

        Header cells help users of Assistive Technology (AT) understand and navigate
        complex tables. When your table is correctly marked up with header cells, AT
        can announce the relevant header information on-demand when entering a cell.

        By default, Typst will automatically mark all cells within @table.header as
        header cells. They will apply to the columns below them. You can use that
        function's @table.header.level[`level`] parameter to make header cells
        labelled by other header cells.

        The `pdf.header-cell` function allows you to indicate that a cell is a
        header cell in the following additional situations:

        - You have a *header column* in which each cell applies to its row. In that
          case, you pass `{"row"}` as an argument to the
          @pdf.header-cell.scope[`scope` parameter] to indicate that the header cell
          applies to the row.
        - You have a cell in @table.header, for example at the very start, that
          labels both its row and column. In that case, you pass `{"both"}` as an
          argument to the @pdf.header-cell.scope[`scope`] parameter.
        - You have a header cell in a row not containing other header cells. In that
          case, you can use this function to mark it as a header cell.

        The API of this feature is temporary. Hence, calling this function requires
        enabling the `a11y-extras` feature flag at the moment. In a future Typst
        release, this functionality may move out of the `pdf` module so that tables
        in other export targets can contain the same information.

        Explicitly defines this cell as a data cell.

        Each cell in a table is either a header cell or a data cell. By default, all
        cells in @table.header are header cells, and all other cells data cells.

        If your header contains a cell that is not a header cell, you can use this
        function to mark it as a data cell.

        The API of this feature is temporary. Hence, calling this function requires
        enabling the `a11y-extras` feature flag at the moment. In a future Typst
        release, this functionality may move out of the `pdf` module so that tables
        in other export targets can contain the same information.

        #show table.cell.where(x: 1, y: 0): set text(style: "normal")
